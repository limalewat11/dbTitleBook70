Here Auerbach, thought by many to be the greatest of twentieth-century scholar-critics, makes the seemingly paradoxical claim that it is in the poetry of Dante, supreme among religious poets, and above all in the stanzas of his <i>Divine Comedy</i>, that the secular world of the modern novel � rst took imaginative form. Auerbach� s study of Dante, a precursor and necessary complement to <i>Mimesis</i>, his magisterial overview of realism in Western literature, illuminates both the overall structure and the individual detail of Dante� s work, showing it to be an extraordinary synthesis of the sensuous and the conceptual, the particular and the universal, that rede� ned notions of human character and fate and opened the way into modernity.<br><br>CONTENTS<br>I.

Here Auerbach, acclaimed by writers and scholars as various as Terry Eagleton, Guy Davenport, and Alfred Kazin as one of the greatest critics of the twentieth century, argues paradoxically but powerfully that it is to Dante, supreme among Christian poets, that we owe the concept of the secular world. Dante&#x2019;s poetry, Auerbach shows, offers an extraordinary synthesis of the sensuous and the conceptual, and individual and the universal, that redefined notions of human character and fate and opened the way into modernity.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a book with all the freshness and excitement of a new discovery. The account of Dante&#x2019;s poetry possesses a validity which no other book, past and present, can diminish.&#x201d; &#x2014;Theodore Silverstein, University of Chicago</p><h2>Emperor: The Gates of Rome (The Emperor Series)</h2><p>Rarely, if ever, does a new writer dazzle us with such a vivid imagination and storytelling, flawlessly capturing the essence of a land, a people, a legend. Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.<br><br>On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family&#x2013;and his adoptive brother&#x2013;will be the most powerful force in his life.<br><br>As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat&#x2013;under the tutelage of one of Rome&#x2019;s most fearsome gladiators&#x2013;Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier&#x2019;s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.<br><br>The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict&#x2013;a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br><br>Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts&#x2013;from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, <b>Emperor, The Gates of Rome</b> is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>"An absorbing portrait of ancient Roman life and history, well written and full of suspense--even for those who know the ending."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>Conn Iggulden is the author of <b>Genghis: Birth of an Empire</b><i>,</i> the first novel in the series, as well as the Emperor<i> </i>novels, which chronicle the life of Julius Caesar: <b>Emperor: The Gates of Rome, Emperor: The Death of Kings, Emperor: The Field of Swords,</b> and <b>Emperor: The Gods of War</b><i>,</i> all of which are available in paperback from Dell.

Award-winning essayist and fiction writer Debra Magpie Earling describes the tribal ways that helped her nineteenth-century Salish ancestors survive, and that still work their magic today. Montana political figure Bill Yellowtail tells of the efficiency of Indian trade networks, explaining how axes that the expedition traded for food in the Mandan and Hidatsa villages of Kansas had already arrived in Nez Perce country by the time Lewis and Clark got there a few months and 1,000 miles later. Umatilla tribal leader Roberta Conner compares Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s journal entries about her people with what was actually going on, wittily questioning Clark&#x2019;s notion that the natives believed the white men &#x201c;came from the clouds&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, they were gods. Writer and artist N. Scott Momaday ends the book with a moving tribute to the &#x201c;most difficult of journeys,&#x201d; calling it, in the truest sense, for both the men who entered the unknown and those who watched, &#x201c;a vision quest,&#x201d; with the &#x201c;visions gained being of profound consequence.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of the essays are based on family stories, some on tribal or American history, still others on the particular circumstances of a tribe today&#x2014;but each reflects the expedition&#x2019;s impact through the prism of the author&#x2019;s own, or the tribe&#x2019;s, point of view.<br><br>Thoughtful, moving, provocative, <i>Lewis and Clark Through Indian Eyes</i> is an exploration of history&#x2014;and a study of survival&#x2014;that expands our knowledge of our country&#x2019;s first inhabitants. It also provides a fascinating and invaluable new perspective on the Lewis and Clark expedition itself and its place in the long history of our continent.</p><p>Alvin M.

We prefer our fantasies in opposition to the facts of life. It was a routine venture now revered because we desperately need to have a heroic past, since that pleasure is denied to us in the present. The expedition was initiated following Jefferson's finesse of Congress and the Constitution in the purchase of a mere claim by France that it "owned" a substantial portion of the North American West because a Frenchman had first set foot on lands drained by the Mississippi. Not only did the expedition seek a practical water route to the West Coast with the eventual goal of opening the Pacific to American commerce, but Jefferson also needed to prove that the purchase of an unknown territory was not a white elephant. (He did, however, caution Lewis and Clark to be on the lookout for mammoths while en route.)<br><br>Since traditionally historians have understood the journey as the first effort by civilized men to pierce the unknown West, we often tend to clothe the accounts of Lewis and Clark in more heroic terms than they seem to have deserved. Much good history falls by the wayside when we stress the heroics and neglect the context of their journey in our understanding. The expedition actually seems to have been a tedious march from one place to another made known to them by Indians and French traders, with an occasional incident to testify to the strangeness of the land and the unique challenges that the West presented.<br><br>After reading through the journals edited by Elliott Coues, my impression of the memorable experiences of the expedition, the things that would have remained with its members years after their return, revolved around three major topics, although I must admit that a strong case might be made for several other themes. But the things that impressed me were the fact that Frenchmen had already explored much of this region so that it was reasonably well known to many people, that there seemed to be an oversupply of bears on the prairies and bottomlands, and that sandbars posed a continuing barrier to the expedition, making the development of a heavy and easy commerce with the Orient via an inland waterway impossible. Indeed, travel later to the Montana area depended heavily on the spring snowmelt and required special flat-bottom boats.<br><br>The accounts of the journey to the West Coast contain those wonderful na�ve observations that always come with first discovery. Consequently the responses of the Corps of Discovery to these new experiences provide us with good insight into their feelings and what they believed they were doing, and record the occasional misfortunes of the group, which became traumas because they were unexpected. Entries on the return trip record fewer surprises and illustrate the confidence and sometimes arrogance that experience often brings.<br><br>That they had the confidence that they could split the little company and explore different river systems with the expectation that they knew the land so well that they could meet again in more familiar territory suggests that they felt they had conquered the West. The final report would therefore be couched in the optimistic terms of men who had overcome severe hardships and now stood ready for another challenge. They had breached the unknown, albeit with considerable assistance from the local inhabitants, and now believed in their own superiority, a mood that would shortly energize people to emulate their feats and bring about the ruination of the Great American West.<br><br>Before we examine the Indian understanding of the expedition, let us walk with the explorers on their first encounter with the land and its peoples. We have traditionally been taught to believe that the Lewis and Clark expedition was the first penetration of white men into the western lands. This belief is totally unfounded. The locations of the Mandan villages, scattered from the present North Dakota-South Dakota line along the Missouri River to some distance above present-day Bismarck, were already common knowledge. French and British traders had already established a thriving commerce with these villages and the sedentary Indians were accustomed to dealing with foreigners.<br><br>A good portion of the trip while moving through wild and unoccupied country did not involve discovery of the West but merely followed paths already well established. Thus when the expedition visited the Yankton Sioux camp, the Indians were flying a Spanish flag, and it is well known that these Sioux had attended the British conference at Albany prior to the American Revolution. They would also send warriors to support the British during the War of 1812. The coastal tribes in Washington and Oregon had already been visited by the English and Spanish and had routed the Spanish expansion.<br><br>More important, however, was the presence of French trappers in the area. The growing population of half-breeds of French-Indian heritage, some people representing second and perhaps even third generations of men out on the plains, indicated that white men had lived among the tribes for a considerable period of time. Above the great bend near present-day Pierre, South Dakota, the expeditioners visited a Frenchman's house that had no protective palisade, testifying to the fact that the French had successfully melded with the Indians long ago.<br><br>French colonial policy had encouraged intermarriage with the Indians and the exchange of children to create kinship bonds with the eastern tribes. The French sought to create a new kind of society of mixed Euro-Indian genetic background that would and could hold the lands claimed by the French king under the Doctrine of Discovery by appealing to their common ancestry. This class of people was now temporarily loyal to whoever could enhance their fortunes. Most of them had extensive experience in wandering the western lands, and, in sharing their knowledge about the land and its people, they enabled Lewis and Clark to anticipate some of the problems that lay ahead. But they had no loyalty to the Americans, nor would they have for some time to come.<br><br>The Frenchmen represented a good deal more than easing the psychological burdens of the unknown lying ahead for the expedition. Indeed, their presence indicated the existence of a society in which manufactured goods were becoming increasingly valuable, as steel knives replaced flint weapons and guns were coveted for both hunting and war. The value to be given in exchange for these industrial products would have to be the skins and hides of animals that were temporarily valuable when beaver hats were stylish or when there was a lack of available leather on the European markets. The land could sustain the wildlife it had but was not so productive that animals could replenish their numbers in the face of extensive hunting above and beyond simple human subsistence. The primary objects of Indian commerce were the hides and skins of the animals that also inhabited the land, and there were a finite number of these creatures, although at the time the herds of grazers seemed without number.<br><br>Actually in the journals we find few references to large herds of buffalo or even to the massive dams and villages of the beaver, whose pelts would later be the primary items of trapping and trading. Beaver seem to merit sparse attention when recording the fauna of the region. There are probably more references to rattlesnakes than to beaver, since the men seemed almost hypnotized by these serpents, hardly an item of trade. Lewis and Clark almost certainly saw the wildlife as a barrier to be overcome and not as commodities that would constitute the major portion of trade for the next eight decades.<br><br>Some of the half-breeds were not descendants of the local tribes. Pierre Dorian, for example, seems to have been part Iowa Indian, as does his wife. Here we see the results of the displacement of tribes in the Midwest who had been trading with the French and British for more than two centuries. Although there had been no removal treaties affecting the midwestern tribes at that time from which these people might have been fleeing, the fabric of their communal life had long since been torn apart by intermarriage and trade wars. As members of the eastern tribes had experienced the course of empire, they joined in and moved west to become a part of the impending invasion and serve as bicultural brokers in the transactions that lay ahead.<br><br>This new class of people would also help open the Pacific Northwest to commerce and exploration. As the Hudson's Bay Company extended its trading posts and influence in the western Rockies and Columbia basin, it employed Iroquois voyageurs who had only a smattering knowledge of the Christian religion but loved to sing Catholic hymns, relying on their rhythms to measure the oar strokes of the trade canoes. These hymns would later inspire the Nez Perces and Flatheads to send a delegation to St. Louis in search of these power songs, triggering the missionary movement toward the Oregon country that ended in disaster for all concerned.<br><br>Could these people be described as an indigenous population as we think of one today? To the expedition they were indistinguishable from the local tribes except for the obvious language differences and the warlike proclivities of the tribes claiming and defending extensive territories. Certainly they were seen as a different class from tribal Indians in Canada, who eventually become known as the Metis (mixed-blood people), the constituency of Louis Riel, who regarded themselves as equal members of Canadian society. They appear later in the 1870s as invaders of the northern hunting grounds, feared and resisted fiercely by the tribes living in the United States. Annually they brought large numbers of hunters with freight wagons and families south across the border to hunt buffalo when their own herds had been thinned out, thus escalating the depletion of the northern buffalo herd more rapidly than expected.<br><br>Certainly the invasive half-breeds played a critical role in arranging the first treaties between the United States and the northern Plains tribes, treaties incidentally negotiated by William Clark after his exploring days were done. As time went on American whites became the scouts, hunters, and interpreters for subsequent expeditions mounted in St. Louis and Leavenworth, and with some exceptions the French-Indian half-breeds declined in importance. Their descendants today dominate tribal politics in most of the Great Lakes and Plains tribes. Indeed, for some tribes, having French ancestors rather than English is a sign of distinction.<br><br>Think of what these people represented, however, and we begin to visualize an alternative possible scenario for the settling of the West. The French colonial policy was to encourage intermarriage with the natives and the exchange of children who would be raised in a different society so that over time they would help create a society that treated lands, resources, and people in a much different manner than the English/Americans did. Would the interior of the United States have been developed with a goal of maintaining a sustainable yield of products rather than of exhausting the resources? Would treaties even have been necessary if the various tribes had adopted enough of French culture that they adapted their institutions to resemble those of western Europe and guaranteed equality in both law and custom to new settlers of the region?<br><br>Could a mixed-blood government have dealt with the United States on better terms? We would like to think so, although the experiences of the Five Civilized Tribes suggest otherwise. But the Five Tribes possessed valuable farming lands in the South, whereas the northern plains hardly offered the settlers much comfort, so the demand for land would not have been as intense. To what degree would mixed-bloods' willingness to accommodate themselves to technology and opportunity have produced an ecologically sound society?<br><br>This distant prospect seems not impossible if we read the journals of the trip. From St. Louis to the Mandan villages it appears that the Frenchmen had a vital place in the region's social environment. Quite casually we learn that the French were building houses and settling in near the Big Bend without any immediate or prolonged conflict with the tribes using the same area as hunting grounds. We can understand the sense of relief felt by the men whenever the expedition came across Frenchmen, as if they had brought the entirety of the European perspective with them. That the Frenchmen felt entirely at home and possessors of the same knowledge of the land as the Indians suggests that in large part the Gallic colonial goal had been achieved.<br><br>The experience of the Yankton Sioux with the French and Americans is interesting and demonstrates how deeply the French had intruded into Indian life. As the Corps of Discovery approached the Yankton Sioux territory they encountered Pierre Dorian, Jr., the son of their interpreter who had ensured that they receive a warm and friendly reception. Instead of the haughty attitude that Lewis and Clark often showed toward Indians, negotiations with the Yanktons went smoothly. Their generosity in giving the chiefs both medals and clothing impressed them. A Yankton chief summarized the difference: "I went formerly to the English, and they gave me some clothes; when I went to the Spanish they gave me a medal. But nothing to keep it from my skin; but now you give me a medal and clothes."</p><h2>Ghostly Matters: Haunting and the Sociological Imagination</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Avery Gordon&#x2019;s stunningly original and provocatively imaginative book explores the connections linking horror, history, and haunting. &#x201d; &#x2014;George Lipsitz</p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;The text is of great value to anyone working on issues pertaining to the fantastic and the uncanny.&#x201d; &#x2014;American Studies International</p><p> </p><p>&#x201c;Ghostly Matters immediately establishes Avery Gordon as a leader among her generation of social and cultural theorists in all fields.

The seventeen men who started the New York to Paris auto race were an international roster of personalities: a charismatic Norwegian outdoorsman, a witty French count, a pair of Italian sophisticates, an aristocratic German army officer, and a cranky mechanic from Buffalo, New York. President Theodore Roosevelt congratulated them by saying, &#x201c;I like people who do something, not the good safe man who stays at home.&#x201d; These men were doing something no man had ever done before, and their journey would take them very far from home.<br><br>Their course was calculated at more than 21,000 miles, across three continents and six countries. It would cross over mountain ranges&#x2014;some as high as 10,000 feet&#x2014;and through Arctic freeze and desert heat, from drifting snow to blowing sand. Bridgeless rivers and seas of mud blocked the way, while wolves, bears, and bandits stalked vast, lonely expanses of the route. And there were no gas stations, no garages, and no replacement parts available. The automobile, after all, had been sold commercially for only fifteen years. Many people along the route had never even seen one.<br><br>Among the heroes of the race were two men who ultimately transcended the others in tenacity, skill, and leadership. Ober-lieutenant Hans Koeppen, a rising officer in the Prussian army, led the German team in their canvas-topped 40-horsepower Protos. His amiable personality belied a core of sheer determination, and by the race&#x2019;s end, he had won the respect of even his toughest critics. His counterpart on the U.S. team was George Schuster, a blue-collar mechanic and son of German immigrants, who led the Americans in their lightweight 60-horsepower Thomas Flyer. A born competitor, Schuster joined the U.S. team as an undistinguished workman, but he would battle Koeppen until the very end. Ultimately the German and the American would be left alone in the race, fighting the elements, exhaustion, and each other until the winning car&#x2019;s glorious entrance into Paris, on July 30, 1908.<br><b>Lincoln&#x2019;s Birthday, February 12, 1908 . . . </b><br><br>The crowds gathering on Broadway all morning were not out to honor Abe Lincoln, either. They were on the avenue to catch sight of the start of the New York-to-Paris Automobile Race. There would only be one&#x2014;one race round the world, one start, and one particular way that, for the people who lived through it, the world would never be the same. The automobile was about to take it all on: not just Broadway, but the farthest reaches to which it could lead. On that absurdity, the auto was about to come of age.<br><br>&#x201c;By ten o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; reported the <i>Tribune</i>, &#x201c;Broadway up to the northernmost reaches of Harlem looked as though everybody was expecting the circus to come to town.&#x201d; The excitement was generated by the potential of the auto to overcome the three challenges most frustrating to the twentieth century: distance, nature, and technology. First, distance: in the form of twenty-two thousand miles of the Northern Hemisphere, from New York west to Paris. Second, nature: in seasons at their most unyielding. And third, the very machinery itself, which would be pressed hard by the race to defeat itself. Barely twenty years old as a contraption and only ten as a practical conveyance, the automobile couldn&#x2019;t reasonably be expected to be ready to take on the world. But there were men who were ready and that was what mattered.<br><br>&#x2014;From <i>Race of the Century</i></p><p>Julie M.

On February 12 in 1908 about three hundred of them were also looking forward to a special feast for Lincoln&#x2019;s Birthday: turkey, cranberry sauce, celery, potatoes, turnips, pie, and coffee, all courtesy of a patron named Delano Weekes.<br><br>Robert T. Lincoln, the son of the sixteenth president, was on the list of guests invited to share the newsboys&#x2019; bounty. As a resident of Chicago, he&#x2019;d already sent his regrets, though. So had another Union leader&#x2019;s son&#x2014;one with a less convincing excuse. George B. McClellan, namesake of Lincoln&#x2019;s early favorite among Yankee generals, was the mayor of New York City in 1908. Bookish and a little vague under the best of circumstances, McClellan had a long list of appearances to make on Lincoln&#x2019;s Birthday, and he sent word in advance that Chambers Street wasn&#x2019;t among them.<br><br>In the early morning, while the newsies were bleating for business and wondering just exactly what kind of pie they&#x2019;d be having later on for dessert, the next round of headlines was sprouting all around them. In Brooklyn, a twenty-eight-year-old tailor from Italy lay dying; he had been shot five times by the mafia, which was surging to new heights of influence in 1908, dumbfounding even hardened Americans with its capacity for violence. &#x201c;The Black Hand wrote to me demanding money,&#x201d; the tailor was telling police early that morning from his deathbed, &#x201c;and I refused. Last night, they sent two men after me. They got me.&#x201d;<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t the only one in trouble. The organizers of the Grande Redoute Rose&#x2014;the Pink Ball&#x2014;were under siege from all of the women on the guest list who didn&#x2019;t happen to own a pink gown, and who couldn&#x2019;t get one in time for the February 14 dance. The committee spent the morning debating whether or not to allow white.<br><br>No one in New York, however, or anywhere else, had a worse day than John J. Grant, a printer by trade. He swallowed poison, slit his wrists, and then jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge&#x2014;and lived. As soon as he was rescued, he was arrested.<br><br>Because schools, government offices, brokerages, and other businesses were closed for Lincoln&#x2019;s Birthday, the stores were crowded right from the start. Macy&#x2019;s celebrated its fiftieth anniversary by putting nearly everything on sale, selling eight-rib umbrellas for $5.00 each. Anyone who bought one could have brought it home in a bag, though; the morning was perfectly clear, with temperatures in the mid-thirties. Automobiles were also on sale in mid-February. &#x201c;This is bargain time,&#x201d; confided one agency in boldface type in the newspaper. Those who believed it could visit the showroom on Broadway north of Times Square, the same neighborhood in which most of New York&#x2019;s car dealerships were located.<br><br>The Broadway Mammoth Automobile Exchange, on Fifty-sixth Street near Broadway, about ten blocks up from Times Square, declared in its own ad that &#x201c;Swell rich man&#x2019;s cars can now be bought cheaper than inferior new ones.&#x201d; Since swell rich men at the time were paying between $6,000 and $12,000, equivalent to about $150,000 to $300,000 today, there was some incentive to look for an overlay. &#x201c;Pierce-Arrow, $850,&#x201d; advertised Broadway Mammoth. &#x201c;Thomases, all models, 1905, 1906, 1907, $600 to $1,500.&#x201d; One reason for the drastic depreciation in price was that a car in those days didn&#x2019;t have a long life on the road; after about ten thousand miles, a customer was presumed to have had his or her money&#x2019;s worth. But then, it would take the average customer three years to log as many as ten thousand miles in 1908.<br><br>In practical terms, the typical secondhand Thomas in the Broadway Mammoth lot had progressed a mere seven blocks, since the Thomas Agency, where the new cars were sold, occupied a building on Broadway at Sixty-third Street. A New Yorker out walking on the brisk morning of the twelfth couldn&#x2019;t fail to notice the Thomas Agency. Nearly every inch of its four-story facade was draped in decoration, with banners at every window. Something special was in the air&#x2014;along with the flapping of a great many flags. All down Broadway, the buildings were decked out in colors and patriotic signs. Lew Dockstader, a popular comedian, was inspired by the display to assume the persona of Abraham Lincoln taking a walk in New York: &#x201c;I was much surprised as well as gratified when I arrived in New York,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;to find myself so well-heralded. I walked up Broadway, and flying from many hotel fronts I noticed bunting and flags telling the glad news that I was here.&#x201d; But then Dockstader&#x2019;s Mr. Lincoln finished by adding, in a rather perplexed way, &#x201c;Someone just told me that the decorations were not for me&#x2014;but for a car race.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowds gathering on Broadway all morning were not out to honor Abe Lincoln, either. They were on the avenue to catch sight of the start of the New York-to-Paris Automobile Race. There would only be one&#x2014;one race round the world, one start, and one particular way that, for the people who lived through it, the world would never be the same. The automobile was about to take it all on: not just Broadway, but the farthest reaches to which it could lead. On that absurdity, the auto was about to come of age.<br><br>&#x201c;By ten o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; reported the Tribune, &#x201c;Broadway up to the northernmost reaches of Harlem looked as though everybody was expecting the circus to come to town.&#x201d; The excitement was generated by the potential of the auto to overcome the three challenges most frustrating to the twentieth century: distance, nature, and technology. First, distance: in the form of twenty-two thousand miles of the Northern Hemisphere, from New York west to Paris. Second, nature: in seasons at their most unyielding. And third, the very machinery itself, which would be pressed hard by the race to defeat itself. Barely twenty years old as a contraption and only ten as a practical conveyance, the automobile couldn&#x2019;t reasonably be expected to be ready to take on the world. But there were men who were ready and that was what mattered.<br><br>The six cars entered in the race were parked in Times Square, facing out of the wide end of the triangle formed by Forty-third Street, Seventh Avenue, and Broadway (which slashes diagonally across Seventh Avenue). For the moment, the cars were separated from the rest of the world by a crowd of a thousand people, who not only wanted to see the start, but touch it. After nine o&#x2019;clock, another thousand or more pressed into Times Square every five minutes.<br><br>&#x201c;The crowd was one of the worst that the police have had to handle in years,&#x201d; reported the Globe. &#x201c;It was one black mass.&#x201d; Three hundred policemen were on hand all morning, charged mainly with keeping a one-lane road open along the route laid out for the cars. If the crowd had its way, after all, the cars would never budge. When a gaggle of women waiting in front of the Cadillac Hotel on Broadway at Forty-third Street grew too merry and spilled over the curb, a detachment of mounted police arrived in seconds to herd them back.<br><br>Times Square wasn&#x2019;t yet a theater district in 1908, but a neighborhood of hotels, watched over by the New York Times Building, the lone skyscraper in the middle of it all, and the source of its name. Ultimately, the race was to head north out of the city. But for the six racecars facing the Times Building across Forty-third Street, the route started south on Broadway for a block, making a turn around the base of the square, before heading north up Seventh Avenue to the intersection at Forty-fifth Street where crooked Broadway barged into Times Square. The cars would then follow Broadway out of the city.<br><br>In the square, the north-south avenues were lined by a double row of cars, two hundred of them in all colors and sizes. Their owners had received special permission to accompany the racers at the start, and for that purpose each had been assigned an immensely valuable parking space well in advance. Once the six racers started moving, the enthusiasts were to peel away from the curb in their autos and join the convoy.<br><br>By 10:30, the crowd surrounding the racecars numbered fifty thousand. In photographs taken from high up in the Times Building, the scene looked as though a blanket had been spread over the square, a blanket made up of black overcoats. Faces popped up out of the black, looking every which way to see something of the cars or the spectacle they had created. Even those people who couldn&#x2019;t see the racers at the starting line could smell gasoline. All the while, the music of a brass band filled the air.<br><br>Celebrities had a special pl...</p><h2>1001 Ways to Market Your Books: For Authors and Publishers, 6th Edition</h2><p>Today&#39;s most complete handbook on book marketing.</p><p>John Kremer's home might be nestled in Iowa cornfields, but his advice on book marketing comes straight from publishing's epicenter. <i>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</i> is a tome of biblical proportion, a 700-page "organized potpourri" of useful ideas, examples, tips, and suggestions.

Devastatingly, her father was in charge of the plant, and the meltdown may have been his fault. Was he drunk when it happened? Thousands of people are forced to flee their homes in the Kingdom; rivers and forests are destroyed; and Emily feels certain that as the daughter of the most hated man in America, she is in danger.

The winds were coming across the lake, and the outside wall that faced the water was flat&#x2014;not like the igloos I had seen on TV somewhere or I guess in a book. It looked like the wall on the inside of a cave: flat and kind of scaly. But the outside wall that faced the city looked round like a melon. I couldn&#x2019;t stand all the way up inside it, but in the middle I could crouch like a hunchback. It was big enough for three people to lie down if you curled up, and one night we had to squeeze in four. But most of the time it was just Cameron and me. I really had to trust the fuck out of someone before I would let them anywhere near Cameron in the night. But, the truth is, people came and went. You know how it is. Especially in the winter. But the igloo kept me warm. Warmer, anyway. I mean, it&#x2019;s not like I got frostbite. I knew kids and grown-ups who did. I knew one kid who got gangrene. They say the doctors had to cut off both of his feet, but I don&#x2019;t know that for a fact because I never saw him again.<br> I&#x2019;m going to try and tell you only the things that I know for a fact are true. When I&#x2019;m guessing, I&#x2019;ll be honest and tell you I&#x2019;m guessing.<br> You build the igloos in the day when the leaves are soaked but the ice has melted from the sun, and then they freeze at night inside the bags. So does the water on the outside of the bags; that&#x2019;s why the bags stick together like glue.<br><br>******<br><br> Some people said I left the shelter because someone must have tried to rape me. No one tried to rape me. I left for a couple of reasons. I mean, I did feel kind of hounded&#x2014;by the other girls, one especially, but not by the people who ran the place. The &#x201c;staff.&#x201d; Whatever. One of the girls was starting to suspect who I was, and I knew that once my secret was out, she&#x2019;d turn me in. I thought she&#x2019;d want no part of me. And you know what? I wouldn&#x2019;t have blamed her. A lot of days I wanted no part of me.<br> Also, I knew the staff wanted me gone. Or, at least, they wanted to figure out who I really was. They were getting pretty frustrated because they couldn&#x2019;t find my parents. My story was starting to unravel. So, I just left.<br> Given that I was always kind of&#x2014;and here&#x2019;s a pretty awesome little euphemism&#x2014;a troubled teen, it&#x2019;s a miracle that the counselors who ran the shelter didn&#x2019;t send me packing a lot sooner. It wouldn&#x2019;t have surprised a lot of people who knew me if I really had managed to get myself thrown out on my ass. But I didn&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s not what happened. I was already plenty scared, and so I tried playing by the rules. I tried to behave. But it didn&#x2019;t work. And so it would be the last time I&#x2019;d try for a while.<br> This was back in the days when the city was still trying to figure out what to do with the walkers. Technically, I was a walker, even though I didn&#x2019;t walk. I stole a bike and rode to the city from the Northeast Kingdom. I don&#x2019;t know how many miles that is, but it took me two full days, because I hadn&#x2019;t ridden a bike since I was in, like, fourth or fifth grade. The worst was going up and over the mountains. I just walked the bike up the eastern slopes. That took an entire afternoon right there. One time a guy in a bread truck gave me a lift, but he only took me about twenty miles. Still, a lot of those miles were uphill, so I was grateful. Lots of people&#x2014;most people&#x2014;had families or friends in the city or the suburbs around Lake Champlain who could take them in. And people were taking&nbsp;in total strangers. Vermonters are like that. I guess decent people anywhere are like that. But there were still a lot of walkers just pitching tents in City Hall Park or sleeping in their cars or pickups or out in the cold, or building their igloos down by the water. Squatters. Refugees.<br> I guess it would have been a lot worse if Reactor Number Two had exploded, as well. You know, gone totally Chernobyl. But it didn&#x2019;t. It was only Reactor Number One that melted down and blew up.&nbsp;<br><br>******<br><br> When I was a little kid, I used to take my American Girl dolls and play orphanage. The make-believe stories were always based on A Little Princess. The movie and the book. Whatever. One of my dolls would be a beautiful rich girl who suddenly winds up poor and in an orphanage. No mom or dad, no aunts or uncles. Some of the other girls hate her, but some love her. The woman I had running the place was always a total whack-job bully. Think of that lunatic in the musical Annie. She was the model. So, I guess, Annie was an inspiration, too. When I got bored, I&#x2019;d simply have the girl rescued. Her dad or her mom and dad would just show up at the orphanage. Boom. Game over.<br> Sometimes I tried playing the game with Barbies, but that never worked. The Barbies looked pretty hot. If they were going to be trapped somewhere, it sure wasn&#x2019;t going to be in an orphanage. It was going to be someplace way more awful. I know that now, too.&nbsp;<br><br>******<br><br> My family had a beautiful woodstove. Not one of those black boxes that look like they do nothing but pollute the crap out of the air. It was made of gray soapstone that was almost the color of my mom&#x2019;s favorite piece of jewelry: an antique necklace that was made of moonstones. I think it had once belonged to my grandmother. It was Danish. Anyway, the woodstove had a window in the front that was shaped like the window in a castle or a palace. I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s a word for that shape, and I will look it up.<br> &nbsp;My dad or mom would build a fire in the woodstove when we were all home on the weekend and hanging around in the den. The den was next to the kitchen, and the woodstove would heat the den and the kitchen and even the TV room on the other side of the kitchen. The rooms had baseboards and LP gas heat, too, of course. The whole house did. It was pretty new. I know now that a lot of people called our kind of house a meadow mansion or a McMansion behind our backs, but we didn&#x2019;t build it. We just moved there from a suburb of New York City when I was a little kid.<br> &nbsp;There was a thermostat stuck through a pipe-cleaner-sized hole in the stovepipe about a foot and a half above the soapstone box. When we had a fire going, my dad wanted it to be around four hundred to six hundred degrees. When it got above six hundred, one of us would close up the flue and the temperature would go down. If it got above eight hundred, you were in danger of a chimney fire. The thermostat was kind of like a car&#x2019;s speedometer: the numbers went a lot higher than you were ever going to need. It went up to seventeen hundred, and you were totally fucked if it ever got that high. We&#x2019;re talking chimney fire for sure.<br> My parents&#x2019; running joke when the woodstove thermostat climbed above six or seven hundred? It was &#x201c;Chernobyling&#x201d;&#x2014;or about to melt down. I can still hear my mom&#x2019;s voice when she would say that to my dad when he would come home from skiing late on a Saturday afternoon: &#x201c;Honey, be sure and watch the stove when you add a log tonight. The damn thing nearly Chernobyled this afternoon.&#x201d; You wouldn&#x2019;t know it from the things people write or say about my dad these days, but he could be very funny. My mom, too. They could both be very funny.<br> I guess that&#x2019;s why I use &#x201c;Chernobyl&#x201d; like a verb.<br> I don&#x2019;t use Fukushima or Fukushima Daiichi like verbs.&nbsp;<br> But I could. After all, Fukushima had a pretty fucked-up end, too. And it even sounds a bit like a swear.&nbsp;<br><br>******<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know why I began my story with the igloo. The igloo was really the beginning of the end&#x2014;or, maybe, the end of the beginning. Here&#x2019;s a sentence I read about me in one of the hospital staff&#x2019;s case management notes: &#x201c;Every kinship had fallen away.&#x201d; Well, yeah. Duh. Even Maggie&#x2014;my dog&#x2014;was gone.<br> By the time I was building my igloo, the worst of the shit-storm was over. At least it was for most of Vermont. It wasn&#x2019;t for me, of course. It wasn&#x2019;t for a lot of us from up in that corner of the Kingdom. But it was for most everyone else. By the time I was building my igloo, I was just another one of the homeless kids who freaked out the middle-aged people at the Banana Republic or Williams-Sonoma when they saw me on the street or in the mall in Burlington.<br> So, maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t begin with the igloo. Maybe I should begin with the posse and the SSI apartment where we crashed. That was a home, too, if a home is a place where you can say you lived for a while. Or I could begin with the Oxies&#x2014;the OxyContin. Or the robbery. Or Andrea Simonetti, who for a few months was like a sister to me, but now I have no idea where she is and I worry. Or I could begin with Poacher or the johns or the tents with the squatters. Or the shelter&#x2014;with the girls in the shelter. Or the people who tried to help me. (Yeah, there were sometimes people who wanted to help me.) Or I could begin with Cameron.<br> Or maybe I should just begin at the beginning.

In <i>A Fine Fleece</i>, designer, knitter, and spinner Lisa Lloyd explores the different qualities of handspun yarn and presents projects that show them to their best advantage. There is valuable information here for every knitter, even if you&#x2019;ve never considered learning to spin (though you may find inspiration in this book to do just that).<br><br>While educating you on the differences in fibers (like Alpaca, Merino, Cormo, Rambouillet, and Suffolk) and the characteristics you can achieve in a handspun yarn by combining fibers according to certain recipes, Lisa Lloyd also shares the three important concepts that enlighten her designs: the use of contrasting color and fiber; scale and perspective (chunky yarns with chunky cable stitches versus chunky yarns with delicate ones); and the creation of &#x201c;poetic&#x201d; sweaters that try to capture an emotion.<br><br>Each of the 26 projects in <i>A Fine Fleece</i> shows the finished project knitted in both a handspun yarn and a commercial yarn so that you can train your eye to understand how fiber and texture can truly transform a piece.</p><p>Lisa Lloyd specializes in traditional knitting and classic looks. She custom-designs yarns, and her knitting patterns have been published by <i>Harrisville Designs</i>, <i>Interweave Knits</i> magazine, and <i>Wild Fibers</i> magazine. Visit her online at www.afinefleece.com.It is clear that Lloyd is conducting a love affair with Aran designs (those wonderfully cabled knits from Ireland) as well as with the concept of blending the best of classic design with contemporary sensibilities. What does that mean? It means a judicious use of cables and twists with body-skimming shapes. Moreover, she figures out how to fashion each of the 26 patterns in hand-spun and in commercial yarns, presented beautifully in photographs and detailed instructions. For those unfamiliar with sheep breeds and &#x201c;outputs,&#x201d; there is a primer on hand spinning, selecting appropriate yarns, and other topics. The patterns present skill level (with clear definitions), measurements, gauge, materials, step-by-step how-to&#x2019;s, and, of course, photographs and graphs, whenever appropriate.

When Kenneth Grahame first entertained his son with letters about a petulant character named Toad, he had no way of knowing that his creation together with his friends Mole, Rat, and Badger would delight children for nearly 100 years. This easy to read adaptation is guaranteed to hook beginning readers not yet ready to tackle the original.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

I must have been about six when the Dalai Lama visited the Stirling Castle Home for Tibetan Children in Shimla, northern India. I was one of more than two hundred children of Tibetan refugees resident there. The home was set up by the British charity Save the Children in 1962 in two former British colonial homes located on a small hill. We children had been busy preparing for the visit, rehearsing welcoming Tibetan songs while the grown-ups swept the road and decorated it with Tibetan symbols in white lime powder&#x2014;lotus, infinite knot, vase, two goldfish (facing each other), eight-spoke wheel of dharma, victory banner, parasol, and conch. The day the Dalai Lama came, there were many Indian policemen around the school; I remember playing marbles with a few of them that morning while we waited. When the moment finally arrived it was magical. Thick smoke billowed from a whitewashed incense stove built especially for the occasion. Dressed in our colorful best and holding <i>kata, </i>the traditional Tibetan white scarves of greeting, in our hands, we stood on both sides of the driveway leading up to the school and sang at the top of our lungs.</p><p>I had been chosen as one of the students to walk alongside the Dalai Lama as he toured the school. While we walked, I asked him if I could become a monk, to which he replied, &#x201c;Study well and you can become a monk anytime you wish.&#x201d; Looking back, I think the only reason I was so precociously attracted to being a monk was because there were two monk teachers at the children&#x2019;s home. They were the kindest of the adults there and also seemed the most learned. They always looked happy and at peace, even radiant at times. Most important for us children, they told the most interesting stories.</p><p>So when the first opportunity came, at the age of eleven&#x2014;and as it happened, on the first day of Tibetan New Year (toward the end of February, that year)&#x2014;I became a monk and joined a monastery, despite my father&#x2019;s protestations. He was upset that I was squandering the opportunity to become the family breadwinner&#x2014;parents of his generation wished for their children to get an education and work in an office. For nearly a decade afterward, I lived, worked, meditated, chanted, and belonged in the small community of Dzongkar Choede monastery. It was there in the quiet evergreen hills of Dharamsala, northern India, that I practiced my rudimentary English with enlightenment-seeking hippies.</p><p>I developed friendships with John and Lars. John was not a hippie. He was an American recluse who lived alone in a nice bungalow he&#x2019;d rented close to the meditation hut of a revered Tibetan master. I met with John once or twice a week. We would speak and I would read from a Tibetan text, which itself is a translation of an eighth-century Indian Buddhist classic. It was John who introduced me to pancakes and ham.</p><p>Lars was a Danish man who lived quite close to the monastery. Often I would visit him to chat and have toast with jam.</p><p>In the spring of 1972, the monastery moved to the scorching heat of southern India, where a Tibetan resettlement program had begun. There, like the other monks of my monastery, at the age of thirteen, I joined the resettlement workforce clearing forests, digging ditches, and working in the cornfields. For the first two years, while the settlement was being prepared, we were paid a daily wage of 0.75 Indian rupees, or roughly 1.5 cents.</p><p>There was very little formal education at Dzongkar Choede. It&#x2019;s not the custom for young monks to go to regular secular schools either. By the time our community moved to South India, I had finished memorizing all the liturgical texts that were required. The day&#x2019;s labor at the settlement finished by four in the afternoon, so I had some free time on my hands and I decided to pick up my English again. However, with no opportunities to practice conversation, I made do with reading comic books. One day, I obtained a cheap used transistor radio, and after that I listened to the BBC World Service and U.S.-based Voice of America every day. In those days, VOA had a unique program &#x201c;broadcasting in special English,&#x201d; in which the presenter spoke slowly and repeated every sentence twice. This was immensely helpful, as I had only a very basic grasp of the language at the time.</p><p>Since I was the only young boy at the monastery who could speak and read English, rudimentarily though it was at first, it was a source of pride and also a way of individuating myself from the others. Here was a world&#x2014;figuratively and literally the whole world beyond the refugee community, beyond the monastery&#x2014;that I alone from my monastic community could enter. Through English I learned to read the globe, which made all the great countries I was hearing about in the news come to life&#x2014;England, America, Russia, and of course, our beloved Tibet, which had tragically fallen to Communist China.</p><p>Around 1976, when I was seventeen or eighteen, I met a remarkable woman who changed my karma with English. Dr. Valentina Stache-Rosen was a German Indologist with expertise in Sanskrit and Chinese texts, living in Bangalore (where her husband headed the Max Muller Institute). Dr. Stache-Rosen took a keen interest in the progress of my English. She introduced me to Western literature and sent me books&#x2014;Hermann Hesse and Agatha Christie, Edgar Snow&#x2019;s <i>Red Star over China</i>, and, most helpfully, a large English dictionary with many examples of words used in sentences. And I first learned to use a knife and fork at Dr. Stache-Rosen&#x2019;s home. We corresponded until her death in 1980. Without her kindness, I can&#x2019;t imagine how my English would have escaped from where it remained back then, or for that matter, where my life would have taken me.</p><p>I also read Trevor Ling&#x2019;s book <i>The Buddha</i>, a portrayal, written in English, of the life and teachings of the Buddha as a revolutionary, philosopher, and spiritual teacher. In this book in particular, the evocative power of the English language deeply impressed me. There was a liveliness and immediacy that I had never felt with written Tibetan; it was like someone speaking. (The gap between written and spoken language in Tibetan is huge.)</p><p>Around the same time, I met the Tibetan teacher who later became one of the most important influences on my classical Buddhist education. Famed for his erudition and poetry, Zemey Rinpoche was the gentlest person I have ever known. He was living a semiretired life then, dedicated to quiet meditative reflection, in another Tibetan settlement about an hour&#x2019;s bus ride from my monastery. I was already familiar with Rinpoche&#x2019;s name from the many Tibetan language school textbooks he had edited. Meeting him in person and speaking with him rekindled the enthusiasm for learning that had originally inspired me to become a monk. From our first meeting, Rinpoche recognized my restless intellect and took me under his wing. So, in the summer of 1978, I left my small monastery to join Ganden, a large academic monastery in another part of southern India, about a ten- to twelve-hour bus ride away.</p><p>In 1985, while on a visit to Dharamsala, North India, twenty years after I&#x2019;d hurried to keep up with His Holiness as a small boy, I had the wonderful, if accidental, honor of being asked to interpret at a teaching given by the Dalai Lama when the scheduled English interpreter couldn&#x2019;t make it on the first day. A few days into the teaching, the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s office informed me that His Holiness wished to see me. At the appointed time, the secretary ushered me into the audience room that is part of the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s office complex, a simple colonial-style bungalow of stone and wood with a green corrugated tin roof. As I entered, His Holiness said, &#x201c;I know you; you are a good debater at Ganden monastery. But I did not know you spoke English.&#x201d; Some Westerners who had heard my interpreting had told the Dalai Lama that my English was easy to listen to. His Holiness asked me if I could be available when he needed someone to interpret for him, especially on his travels. I was in tears. I had never, even in a dream, imagined that one day I would have the honor of serving the Dalai Lama so closely. Needless to say, I replied that this would be the greatest honor.</p><p>For a Tibetan who grew up as a refugee in India, serving the Dalai Lama&#x2014;so deeply revered by the Tibetan people&#x2014;is also a way to honor the sacrifices our parents had to make in their early years of exile.</p><p>So I began accompanying the Dalai Lama on his international travels, interpreting for him with English-speaking audiences and colleagues in the multidisciplinary field of contemplative studies, including at major scientific meetings like the Mind and Life Dialogues, and assisting him on his book projects. In these capacities, I have been the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s principal English translator since 1985, serving this remarkable voice of compassion for nearly three decades now.</p><p>Right from the beginning His Holiness was clear that I would not join his permanent staff. He said that this would be a waste of my monastic education and talent. He advised me instead to concentrate on my studies and pursue an independent life dedicated to scholarship. This was truly compassionate.</p><p>Over time I came to recognize that my personal destiny might lie in serving as a medium for my own classical Tibetan Buddhist tradition in the contemporary world. Perhaps the strange background of my youth&#x2014;growing up in a monastery yet with a fascination for the English language and things Western&#x2014;had prepared me for this role. There weren&#x2019;t many people trained in the classical Buddhist tradition who also knew English then. As my facility with English improved, it dawned on me that I might have a special role to play at the interface of two cultures I loved.</p><p>The motivation to fulfill this destiny more efficiently took me to Cambridge University, in England, beginning a new phase in my life. Thanks to the kindness of so many people, I have been fortunate to be able to dedicate my professional life to being such a medium of cultural interchange, whether through serving the Dalai Lama or translating key Tibetan texts into English. My experiences have confirmed that early intuition that a lot of good could come from the meeting of classical Tibetan Buddhist tradition and contemporary thought and culture, including science. This book is part of this larger work of cross-cultural interpretation.</p><p>I have been interested in compassion my whole life. In my childhood, I was at the receiving end of other people&#x2019;s compassion. Thanks to thousands of ordinary British citizens who contributed to Save the Children, more than a thousand Tibetan children like me found a home to grow up in safely in the early 1960s, while our parents struggled to adjust as refugees in a land where they did not speak the language or know the customs. Thanks to individuals such as Dr. Valentina Stache-Rosen and Zemey Rinpoche, I found a purpose as I struggled through my very unconventional education. In my professional life, serving the Dalai Lama so closely, I have had the privilege of witnessing, from the front seat as it were, what it means for someone to live a life with complete conviction in this defining human quality we call compassion.</p><p>Today I am a husband and a father of two teenage daughters. I live in a North American city and lead a life very different from the one I was used to in a Tibetan monastery in India. On a daily basis, I struggle like most people with the typical challenges of a fast-paced modern life&#x2014;balancing work, family, and relationships, paying the bills&#x2014;while maintaining sanity, a sense of proportion, and basic optimism. Remarkably, it&#x2019;s in the teachings of my own Tibetan Buddhist tradition that I find many of the tools that help me navigate the challenges of everyday living in the contemporary world. I hope to share some of these in this book.</p><p>What is compassion? Most of us value compassion and agree that it is important both in our own lives as well as in society more generally. Undeniably, compassion is also part of our everyday experience of being human. We love and care for our children; confronted with someone in pain, we instinctively feel for that person; when someone reaches out to us in a time of distress we feel touched. Most of us would also agree that compassion has something to do with what it means to lead a good life. So it&#x2019;s no small coincidence that compassion turns out to be the common ground where the ethical teachings of all major traditions, religious and humanistic, come together. Even in the contested political arena, compassion is one value that both sides of the spectrum are eager to claim.</p><p>Despite our widely shared experience and beliefs about compassion, we fail to give it a central role in our lives and in our society. In our contemporary culture, we tend to have a rather confused relationship with values like kindness and compassion. In the secular West, we lack a coherent cultural framework for articulating what compassion is and how it works. To some people, it&#x2019;s a matter of religion and morality, a private concern of the individual with little or no societal relevance. Others question the very possibility of selflessness for human beings, and are suspicious of sentiments like compassion that have other people&#x2019;s welfare as the primary concern. A well-known scientist once remarked, &#x201c;Scratch an altruist and watch a hypocrite bleed.&#x201d; At the other extreme, some people elevate these qualities to such heights that they are out of reach for most of us, possible only for exceptional individuals like Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama. Compassion then becomes something to be admired at a distance in great beings, but not relevant to our everyday lives.</p><p>Broadly defined, compassion is <i>a sense of concern that arises when we are confronted with another&#x2019;s suffering and feel motivated to see that suffering relieved</i>. The English word <i>compassion</i>, from its Latin root, literally means &#x201c;to suffer with.&#x201d; According to religious historian Karen Armstrong, the word for <i>compassion</i> in Semitic languages&#x2014;<i>rahamanut</i> in Hebrew and <i>rahman</i> in Arabic&#x2014;is etymologically related to the word for womb, evoking the mother&#x2019;s love for her child as an archetypal expression of our compassion. At its core, compassion is a response to the inevitable reality of our human condition&#x2014;our experience of pain and sorrow.</p><p>Compassion offers the possibility of responding to suffering with understanding, patience, and kindness rather than, say, fear and repulsion. As such, compassion lets us open ourselves to the reality of suffering and seek its alleviation. Compassion is what connects the feeling of empathy to acts of kindness, generosity, and other expressions of our altruistic tendencies.</p><p>When compassion arises in us in the face of need or suffering, three things happen almost instantaneously: We perceive the other&#x2019;s suffering or need; we emotionally connect with that need or suffering; and we respond instinctively by wishing to see that situation relieved. Compassion may lead to action; it is a readiness to help or wanting to do something ourselves a...</p></p><h2>Case Histories: A Novel</h2><p>A triumphant new novel from award-winner Kate Atkinson: a breathtaking story of families divided, love lost and found, and the mysteries of fate.Case One: Olivia Land, youngest and most beloved of the Land girls, goes missing in the night and is never seen again.

A HEAT WAVE IN THE MIDDLE of the school holidays, exactly where it belonged. Every morning the sun was up long before they were, making a mockery of the flimsy summer curtains that hung limply at their bedroom windows, a sun already hot and sticky with promise before Olivia even opened her eyes. Olivia, as reliable as a rooster, always the first to wake, so that no one in the house had bothered with an alarm clock since she was born three years ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Olivia, the youngest and therefore the one currently sleeping in the small back bedroom with the nursery-rhyme wallpaper, a room that all of them had occupied and been ousted from in turn. Olivia, as cute as a button, they were all agreed, even Julia who had taken a long time to get over being displaced as the baby of the family, a position she had occupied for five satisfying years before Olivia came along.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary, their mother, said that she wished Olivia could stay at this age for ever because she was so <i>lovable</i>. They had never heard her use that word to describe any of them. They had not even realized that such a word existed in her vocabulary, which was usually restricted to tedious commands &#x2013; <i>come here, go away, be quiet, </i>and &#x2013; most frequent of all &#x2013; <i>stop that</i>. Sometimes she would walk into a room or appear in the garden, glare at them and say, <i>whatever it is you&#x2019;re doing, don&#x2019;t</i>, and then simply walk away again, leaving them feeling aggrieved and badly done by, even when caught red-handed in the middle of some piece of mischief &#x2013; devised by Sylvia usually.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their capacity for wrongdoing, especially under Sylvia&#x2019;s reckless leader ship, was apparently limitless. The eldest three were (everyone agreed) &#x2018;a handful&#x2019;, too close together in age to be distinguishable to their mother so that they had evolved into a collective child to which she found it hard to attribute individual details and which she addressed at random &#x2013; <i>Julia-Sylvia-Amelia-whoever you are </i>&#x2013; said in an exasperated tone as if it was their fault there were so many of them. Olivia was usually excluded from this weary litany; Rosemary never seemed to get her mixed up with the rest of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>They had supposed Olivia would be the last to occupy the small back bedroom and that one day the nursery-rhyme wallpaper would finally be scraped off (by their harassed mother because their father said hiring a professional decorator was a waste of money) and be replaced by something more grown-up &#x2013; flowers or perhaps ponies, although anything would be better than the Elastoplast pink adorning the room that Julia and Amelia shared, a colour that had looked so promising to the two of them on the paint chart and proved so alarming on the walls and which their mother said she didn&#x2019;t have the time or money (or <i>energy</i>) to replace.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now it transpired that Olivia was going to be undertaking the same rite of passage as her older sisters, leaving behind the &#x2013; rather badly aligned &#x2013; Humpty-Dumptys and Little Miss Muffets to make way for an <i>afterthought </i>whose advent had been announced, in a rather offhand way, by Rosemary the previous day as she dished out a makeshift lunch of corned-beef sandwiches and orange squash on the lawn.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t Olivia the afterthought?&#x2019; Sylvia said to no one in par ticular, and Rosemary frowned at her eldest daughter as if she had just noticed her for the first time. Sylvia, thirteen and until recently an enthusiastic child (many people would have said overenthusiastic), promised to be a mordant cynic in her teenage years. Gawky, be spectacled Sylvia, her teeth recently caged in ugly orthodontic braces, had greasy hair, a hooting laugh and the long, thin fingers and toes of a creature from outer space. Well-meaning people called her an &#x2018;ugly duckling&#x2019; (said to her face, as if it was a compliment, which was certainly not how it was taken by Sylvia), imagining a future Sylvia casting off her braces, acquiring contact lenses and a bosom, and blossoming into a swan. Rosemary did not see the swan in Sylvia, especially when she had a shred of corned beef stuck in her braces. Sylvia had recently developed an unhealthy obsession with religion, claiming that God had spoken to her. Rosemary wondered if it was a normal phase that adolescent girls went through, if God was merely an alternative to pop stars or ponies. Rosemary decided it was best to ignore Sylvia&#x2019;s t�te-�-t�tes with the Almighty. And at least conversations with God were free, whereas the upkeep on a pony would have cost a fortune.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the peculiar fainting fits that their GP said were on account of Sylvia &#x2018;outgrowing her strength&#x2019; &#x2013; a medically dubious explan ation if ever there was one (in Rosemary&#x2019;s opinion). Rosemary decided to ignore the fainting fits as well. They were probably just Sylvia&#x2019;s way of getting attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary married their father Victor when she was eighteen years old &#x2013; only five years older than Sylvia was now. The idea that Sylvia might be grown-up enough in five years&#x2019; time to marry anyone struck Rosemary as ridiculous and reinforced her belief that her own parents should have stepped in and stopped her marrying Victor, should have pointed out that she was a mere child and he was a thirty-six-year-old man. She often found herself wanting to remonstrate with her mother and father about their lack of parental care, but her mother had succumbed to stomach cancer not long after Amelia was born and her father had re married and moved to Ipswich, where he spent most of his days in the bookies and all of his evenings in the pub.<br>&nbsp;<br>If, in five years&#x2019; time, Sylvia brought home a thirty-six-year-old, cradle-snatching fianc� (particularly if he claimed to be a great mathematician) then Rosemary thought she would probably cut his heart out with the carving knife. This thought was so agreeable that the <i>afterthought</i>&#x2019;<i>s </i>annunciation was temporarily forgotten and Rosemary allowed them all to run out to the ice-cream van when it declared its own melodic arrival in the street.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Sylvia-Amelia-Julia trio knew that there was no such thing as an <i>afterthought </i>and the &#x2018;foetus&#x2019;, as Sylvia insisted on calling it (she was keen on science subjects), that was making their mother so irritable and lethargic was probably their father&#x2019;s last-ditch attempt to acquire a son. He was not a father who doted on daughters, he showed no real fondness for any of them, only Sylvia occasionally winning his respect because she was &#x2018;good at maths&#x2019;. Victor was a mathematician and lived a rarefied life of the mind where his family were allowed o trespass. This was made easy by the fact that he spent hardly any time with them: he was either in the department or in his rooms in college and when he was home he shut himself in his study, occasionally with his students but usually on his own. Their father had never taken them to the open-air pool on Jesus Green, played rousing games of Snap or Donkey, never tossed them in the air and caught them or pushed them on a swing, had never taken them punting on the river or walking on the Fens or on educational trips to the Fitzwilliam. More like an absence than a presence, everything he was &#x2013; and was not &#x2013; was represented by the sacrosanct space of his study.<br>&nbsp;<br>They would have been surprised to know that the study had once been a bright parlour with a view of the back garden, a room where previous occupants of the house had enjoyed pleasant breakfasts, where women had whiled away the afternoons with sewing and romantic novels, and where in the evenings the family had gathered to play cribbage or Scrabble while listening to a radio play. All of these activities had been envisaged by a newly married Rosemary when the house was first bought &#x2013; in 1956, at a price way beyond their budget &#x2013; but Victor immediately claimed the room as his own and somehow managed to transform it into a sunless place, crammed with heavy bookshelves and ugly oak filing cabinets, and reeking of the untipped Capstans that he smoked. The loss of the room was as nothing to the loss of the way of life that Rosemary had planned to fill it with.<br>&nbsp;<br>What he actually did in there was a mystery to all of them. Something so important, apparently, that his home life was trifling in comparison. Their mother said he was <i>a great mathematician</i>, at work on a piece of research that would one day make him <i>famous</i>, yet on the rare occasions when the study door was left open and they caught a glimpse of their father at work, all he seemed to be doing was sitting at his desk, scowling into empty space.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was not to be disturbed when he was working, especially not by shrieking, screaming, savage little girls. The complete inability of those same savage little girls to abstain from the shrieking and the screaming (not to mention the yelling, the blubbing, and the strange howling like a pack of wolves that Victor had never managed to fathom) made for a fragile relationship between father and daughters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary&#x2019;s chastisements may have washed over them like water but the sight of Victor lumbering out of his study, roused like a bear from hibernation, was strangely terrifying and although they spent their lives challenging all that was outlawed by their mother, they never once thought of exploring the forbidden interiorof the study. The only time they were ushered into the gloomy depths of Victor&#x2019;s den was for help with their maths homework. This wasn&#x2019;t so bad for Sylvia, who had a fighting chance of understanding the greasy pencil marks with which an impatient Victor covered endless pages of ruled paper, but as far as Julia and Amelia were concerned Victor&#x2019;s signs and symbols were as mysterious as ancient hieroglyphs. If they thought of the study at all, which they tried not to, they thought of it as a torture chamber. Victor blamed Rosemary for their innumeracy &#x2013; it was clearly their mother&#x2019;s deficient female brain they had inherited.<br>&nbsp;<br>Victor&#x2019;s own mother, Ellen, had lent a sweet and balmy presence to his early infancy before being taken off to a lunatic asylum in 1924. Victor was only four at the time and it was judged better for him not to visit his mother in such disturbing quarters, with the result that he grew up imagining her as a raving madwoman of the Victorian variety &#x2013; long white nightdress and wild hair, roaming the corridors of the asylum at night, prattling nonsense like a child &#x2013; and it was only much later in his life that he discovered that his mother had not &#x2018;gone insane&#x2019; (the family&#x2019;s term for it) but had suffered a severe post-partum depression after giving birth to a stillborn baby and neither raved nor prattled but lived sadly and solitarily in a room decorated with photographs of Victor, until she died of tuberculosis when Victor was ten.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oswald, Victor&#x2019;s father, had packed his son off to boarding school by then and when Oswald himself died, accidentally falling into the freezing waters of the Southern Ocean, Victor received the news calmly and returned to the particularly difficult mathematical puzzle he had been working on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Before the war, Victor&#x2019;s father had been that most arcane and useless of English creatures, a polar explorer, and Victor was rather glad that he would no longer have to live up to the heroic image of Oswald Land and could become great in his own, less valiant, field.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Victor met Rosemary when he had to go to the casualty department at Addenbrooke&#x2019;s, where she was a student nurse. He had tripped down some steps and fallen awkwardly on his wrist but he told Rosemary that he&#x2019;d been on his bike when he was &#x2018;cut up&#x2019; by a car on the Newmarket Road. &#x2018;Cut up&#x2019; sounded good to his ears, it was a phrase from a masculine world he&#x2019;d never managed to inhabit successfully (the world of his father), and &#x2018;the Newmarket Road&#x2019; implied (untruthfully) that he didn&#x2019;t spend his whole life cloistered in the limited area between St John&#x2019;s and the maths department.<br>&nbsp;<br>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for this chance hospital encounter, accidental in all senses, Victor might never have courted a girl. He already felt well on his way to middle age and his social life was still limited to the chess club. Victor didn&#x2019;t really feel the need for another person in his life, in fact he found the concept of &#x2018;sharing&#x2019; a life bizarre. He had mathematics, which filled up his time almost completely, so he wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure what he wanted with a wife. Women seemed to him to be in possession of all kinds of un desirable properties, chiefly madness, but also a multiplicity of physical drawbacks &#x2013; blood, sex, children &#x2013; which were unsettling and <i>other</i>. Yet something in him yearned to be surrounded by the kind of activity and warmth so missing in his own childhood, which was how, before he even knew what had happened, like opening the door to the wrong room, he found himself taking tea in a cottage in rural Norfolk while Rosemary shyly displayed a (rather cheap) diamond-chip engagement ring to her parents.<br>&nbsp;<br>Apart from her father&#x2019;s whiskery bedtime benedictions, Victor was the first man Rosemary had ever been kissed by (albeit awkwardly, lunging at her like an elephant seal). Rosemary&#x2019;s father, a railway signalman, and her mother, a housewife, were startled when she brought Victor home to meet them. They were awed by his undoubted intellectual credentials (the black-rimmed spectacles, the shabby sports jacket, the air of permanent distraction), and the possibility that he might even be a bona fide genius (a possibility not exactly refuted by Victor), not to mention the fact that he had chosen their daughter &#x2013; a quiet and easily influenced girl, hitherto overlooked by almost everyone &#x2013; to be his helpmeet.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that he was twice Rosemary&#x2019;s age didn&#x2019;t seem to worry them at all, although later, when the happy couple had departed, Rosemary&#x2019;s father, a manly type of man, did point out to his wife that Victor was not &#x2018;a great physical specimen&#x2019;. Rosemary&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s only reservation, however, was that although Victor was a doctor he seemed to have trouble giving her any advice about the stomach pains that she was a martyr to. Cornered at a tea table covered with a Maltese lace cloth and loaded with macaroons, Devon scones and seed cake, Victor finally confirmed, &#x2018;Indigestion, I expect, Mrs Vane,&#x2019; a misdiagnosis that she accepted with relief.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Olivia opened her eyes and stared contentedly at the nursery-rhyme wallpaper. Jack and Jill toiled endlessly up the hill, Jill carrying a wooden bucket for the well she was destined never to reach, while elsewhere on the same hillside Little Bo-Peep was searching for her lost sheep. Olivia wasn&#x2019;t too worried about the fate of the flock because she could see a pretty lamb with a blue ribbon round its neck, hiding behind a hedge. Olivia didn&#x2019;t really understand the <i>afterthought </i>but she would have welcomed a baby. She liked babies and animals better than anything. She could feel the weight of Rascal, the family terrier, near her feet. It was <i>absolutely forbidden </i>for Rascal to sleep in the bedrooms but every night one or other of them smuggled him into their room, although by morni...</p><h2>Mark Hampton: An American Decorator</h2><p>A celebration of the career of the late interior designer Mark Hampton (1940&#x2013;1998), whom the New York Times called "an icon of American Style." <br><br>In the tradition of <i>Albert Hadley</i> and <i>David Hicks</i>, this is a comprehensive look at the career of the late Mark Hampton, one of the most famous and admired American interior designers of the twentieth century. A classic American success story, Hampton grew up in small-town Indiana and went on to worldwide fame. He began his career working for some of the greatest interior designers of the age: Mrs. Henry Parish II, David Hicks, and McMillen, Inc. He later went on to design for such clients as Brooke Astor, Estee Lauder, Jacqueline Onassis, and the Henry Kissingers, in addition to his work on the White House, Camp David, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, and the American Academy in Rome. Known for the tremendous depth and breadth of his knowledge, Hampton refused to be pigeonholed into a trademark style, moving effortlessly from sleek modernism to English country and back again. A highly popular lecturer who drew crowds, Hampton was also the author of two books, as well as a designer of both furniture and fabrics. <br><br>Rich with original materials including Hampton&#x2019;s watercolors, sketches, and notebooks, as well as hundreds of images of Hampton&#x2019;s important commissions, and impeccably researched and intimately written by his widow, Duane Hampton, this will be a visual feast for everyone interested in interiors as well as an important addition to the history of interior design.</p><p><b>Duane Hampton</b> is the widow of the late Mark Hampton and a writer and editor in the field of interior decoration.

Creating your ideal sanctuary involves hundreds of practical decisions from where to locate the shop and which machines and tools to buy to where to put the lights and electrical outlets.<br> <br> With the expert advice of professional woodworker and author Sandor Nagyszalanczy, you'll make the right choices to fit your space and budget. Detailed illustrations and useful tips help you handle every job, from insulating walls and organizing storage to installing dust collection. 'Shop Profiles' give you a look inside the shops of well-known woodworkers, so you can see how they've tackled common shop problems.<br> <br> With all the ingenious solutions in <strong><i>Setting Up Shop</i></strong>, you'll never run out of ideas for improving an existing shop or planning the shop of your dreams.</p></p><p><i>Setting Up Shop</i> is designed both for professional craftspeople who often have the poorest and most sparsely equipped shops because they are too busy to make improvements, and for hobbyists and weekend warriors who need a shop for entertainment as much getting work done. Author Sandor Nagyszalanczy does a good job of pointing out the relative benefits and drawbacks to various shop configurations and locations. In fact, one entire page is devoted to a chart comparing shops located in attics, basements, garages, or a spare room in the house, and how each rates for various factors, including noise, dust, headroom, access, structural limitations, heating, cooling, and moisture. This is a great how-to book with very useful topics in each chapter, including upgrading your electrical system; making sure you have the proper lighting, heating, and ventilation for your shop; picking the right tools and brands; deciding where to place machines and tools, benches and work areas; ensuring shop safety; methods for collecting dust; and more. <p> Each chapter is personalized with a visit to the shop of one craftsperson or another. The journey is made better by more than 240 color photos, as well as a healthy dose of black-and-white photos and line drawings. In the end, of course, the definition of a good or a smart shop is fluid, depending on its primary use and the need to change things from time to time. And both professional and hobbyist woodmakers can have as much pride in their shop as they do in a handmade chair. Nagyszalanczy has worked out of the same shop for nearly 20 years and admits that he takes offense when someone refers to it as a "garage." "You have to follow your heart as well as use your mind," Nagyszalanczy writes, "when transforming a simple building that others might call a shed or a garage into what you proudly call your woodshop." <i>--John Russell</i></p>Sandor Nagyszalanczy of Bonny Doon, California is a professional furniture designer and freelance writer, photographer and consultant.

A biographical sketch and note from each one follows every selection. The collection starts off with Delia Sherman's "Cotillion," a luscious and romantic version of "Tam Lin" set in Manhattan, 1969. Diana Wynne Jones's "Little Dot" will charm anyone who has ever loved a cat. Kara Dalkey elegantly retells Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen" in "The Lady of the Ice Garden," and fans of Sherwood Smith's Crown Duel (Harcourt, 1997) will find great pleasure in "Beauty," his charming tale of one of Meliara and Shevraeth's children. Nancy Springer slyly twits the movers and shakers of the world in "Mariposa," a comic tale about a woman looking for her soul. An adaptation of the folksong "The Black Fox" by Emma Bull is complemented by Charles Vess's fine graphic interpretation. "The Baby in the Night Deposit Box" by Megan Whalen Turner is a sweetly daffy look at how evil can be beaten with rules and regulations. In Lloyd Alexander's devastating "Max Mondrosch," a man tries to do everything in his power to get by and still fails utterly. The most disturbing story in the collection, however, is Garth Nix's "Hope Chest," in which innocent Alice May is saddled with the task of saving her family and her town from the creeping shadow of evil.

Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H.

In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>The latest Peter Shandy adventure is the ultimate in escapism: an utterly hilarious albeit totally unbelievable caper that MacLeod ( The Corpse in Oozak's Pond ) fans will savor. Helen Shandy, a librarian in Balaclava County, Mass., and wife of Peter, a professor of agriculture at the local college, is busy roaming the countryside photographing antique weather vanes created by Praxiteles Lumpkin for a pamphlet to be issued by the area's historical society. She discovers, however, that many of the treasures are being stolen by a gang of thieves. After the culprits burn down the local soap factory, which was once topped by a Lumpkin vane, Helen decides to travel to Sasquamahoc, Maine, the site of another priceless Praxiteles, before a calamity befalls it. While in Maine, Helen and two women friends decide to go whale-watching, but the excursion becomes a nightmare when the vane snatchers take over the ship. Eventually, Helen and Peter piece together enough clues to uncover the thieves' ringleader and save the Lumpkins. Another solid performance from MacLeod and the Shandys. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Our Own Words: Extraordinary Speeches of the American Century</h2><p>ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF EXTRAORDINARY SPEECHES, ONE TIMELESS COLLECTION.<br><i>In Our Own Words</i> is a record of the most impassioned, inspirational, and infuriating orations ever given by Americans in this century. Featured here are the words of poets and politicians, artists and astronauts, scoundrels and sports heroes, Native Americans and Nobel laureates, soldiers and civil rights activists, humorists and hellraisers. The most comprehensive collection of American oratory ever assembled, <i>In Our Own Words</i> includes over 150 speeches, sermons, eulogies, radio broadcasts, courtroom pleas, fireside chats, public tributes, and commencement addresses.<br>Beginning on the eve of the twentieth century, this collection spans the Progressive Era, the Depression, two World Wars, the civil rights movement, McCarthyism, Vietnam, feminism, the Reagan years, and the technological revolution, bringing us right up to the threshold of the new millennium, The words of these men and women, known and unknown, challenged the conscience of this country, summoned the nation to wan brought down tyrants, paid homage to fallen heroes, gave a voice to the poor and oppressed, and energized the soul and spirit of America in its most desperate times.<br>To hear the voices of these extraordinary Americans once again or for the first time is to sit in the front row of the history of this century, decade by decade. We find both well-known and little-known speeches by the Roosevelts and the Kennedys, Mark Twain, General George S. Patton, Ronald Reagan, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Helen Keller, Billy Graham, Malcolm X, Clarence Darrow, Rachel Carson, Will Rogers, Betty Friedan, Orson Welles, Lou Gehrig, Jane Fonda, Carl Sagan, Jackie Robinson, Charlton Heston, Pearl Buck, Vince Lombardi, Elie Wiesel, and Duke Ellington. Over a hundred more visionaries and villains, leaders and preachers, radicals and revolutionaries tell the story of their age from their bully pulpits and convention halls, their soapboxes and podiums. These are the voices of our nation.<br>No other century could have produced such dramatic oratory.<br>No other collection could have captured it more powerfully.</p><p>Bill Clinton's televised confession in the tawdry matter of Monica Lewinsky may not qualify as a sterling political moment, or even as a particularly inspired act of oratory. Whether seen as a gesture of remorse or an evasion, that apology was certainly extraordinary by any measure, and Senator Robert Torricelli rightly includes it here. <i>In Our Own Words</i> is his anthology of what he deems to be exceptional American speechifying. (Clinton's first draft was a more accomplished piece of writing and pleading forgiveness than the truculent final version; Torricelli and coeditor Andrew Carroll include both texts.)<p> Torricelli and Carroll's working definition of what constitutes a speech is broad, and arguably so. It encompasses not only such fine moments of public rhetoric as Notre Dame president Charles O'Donnell's eulogy to football coach Knute Rockne and Dwight Eisenhower's warning about the growing power of what he called the "military-industrial complex," but also actress Jane Fonda's wartime radio broadcasts from Hanoi and Frank Zappa's congressional testimony against proposed measures to initiate a national rating system for recorded music--not exactly speeches, a purist might object, but still useful primary sources for students of the recent past.</p><p> A practiced speechmaker himself, Torricelli brings in the voices not only of legislators and politicians, but also of ordinary people moved to heights of eloquence. The result is an eminently readable collection spanning the last hundred years, useful to students of history and of public discourse. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>As someone who has always admired Kirkus' objectivity in its reviews, I was disappointed to read the above comments about "IN OUR OWN WORDS: Extraordinary Speeches of the American Century," a book I co-edited with Senator Robert Torricelli. Criticism I don't mind, and-if balanced and well thought out-I actually welcome. But inaccurate and misleading statements I believe deserve a response.<p> * Let's begin with the falsehoods. The anonymous Kirkus reviewer states, as evidence of our supposed liberal slant, that the speeches concerning the Vietnam War are three-to-one against. Wrong. It's evenly split, four to four. (Not a big deal, I concede, but the record should be set straight. More important, it's indicative of a larger bias on the reviewer's part.) </p><p> * Second, I cannot for the life of me understand why the reviewer said that the only Republicans we featured ("from Goldwater to Nixon and Agnew") are demonized. We credited Goldwater with launching the modern conservative movement, and I personally consider his address to the 1964 Republican National Convention to be one of the most dynamic and passionate speeches in the book. We hailed Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith for boldly standing up to those who trampled on the Constitution for political gain during the Red Scare of the 1950s. We included several extraordinary speeches by Ronald Reagan and even used his address before the Berlin Wall as the epigraph for the entire 1980s chapter. (There are also first-rate speeches by Charlton Heston, IKE, Theodore Roosevelt, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Clarence Thomas, Phyllis Schlafly, and many other influential conservatives.) As to Nixon and Agnew, I fear our reviewer is projecting history's judgments-not ours-on these two men. We simply state the facts in their respective headnotes, as we do with everyone else. There is no escaping that President Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and Vice President Agnew was put on probation for tax evasion as well as for accepting payoffs. </p><p> * It is also curious that the Kirkus reviewer suggests, despite the fact there are no comments in the book to indicate a preference on our part, that when we include someone like Jane Fonda making pro-Communist statements (which I personally found to be repulsive) we are therefore endorsing her views, but when we include a more conservative voice we are therefore "demonizing" it. Was Jimmy Carter demonized because we included the "malaise" speech he gave to a nation mired in high inflation, unemployment, and long gas lines? (All of which we emphasized.) The headnotes for other speeches by Democrats are equally as blunt, but the Kirkus reviewer mysteriously disregards this. </p><p> * To go on to say "there's a plurality of voices for progressive, liberal, and anarchist causes" is also simply untrue. Yes, there are many liberal voices in the collection, and there is one speech by Emma Goldman, an avowed anarchist. But the great majority of the book's speeches would be considered by sensible people to be patriotic and pro-democracy. And even the speeches that are often labelled as more "progressive" in nature, like Cesar Chavez's or Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous orations, appeal to the underlying principles of this country-free speech, freedom of assembly, and justice for all. I would hope that such ideals transcend political associations. </p><p> * It is also a pity the Kirkus reviewer focuses primarily on the political aspect of the book, as so many of the speeches in the collection are by sports legends (Lou Gehrig, Jackie Robinson, and Vince Lombardi), religious leaders (Billy Graham, Eli Wiesel, among many others), poets and writers (Carl Sandburg, William Faulkner, Jack Kerouac, and Rachel Carson), musicians (Duke Ellington and Frank Zappa), great military leaders (Patton and MacArthur), and so many other Americans from all walks of life.</p><p> * What struck me the most about the Kirkus review, however, was the almost offhanded dismissal of the speeches by "supporters of social spending, prison reform, abortion, [sic] AIDS victims, drug addicts." To lump them together, which Kirkus does, as "sundry politically correct minorities" is sloppy reviewing at best, and offensive at worst. These individuals, as anyone who has actually read the book can attest, represent a diverse spectrum of voices and ideas. If there is one similarity, it is that they all express themselves with great power and poignancy. Ryan White was only a teenager when he spoke in humble but heartbreaking detail before a presidential AIDS committee about the daily humiliations he faced because he had contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. When Patricia Godley stood up at a town meeting (broadcast live by Nightline) and talked, without notes, about the pain of losing her son to drugs and her own addiction, the audience was mesmerized by the passion of her delivery and the struggles she had overcome. She spoke movingly of the need for society to treat all people-including drug addicts-with compassion and respect, but she also spoke of personal responsibility. Ultimately, I believe that featuring ordinary Americans who faced extraordinary circumstances with courage and dignity demonstrates both the perserverance of the human spirit and the power of words to educate and inspire us all. Looking over the Kirkus review again, I think I know what happened, and it is not entirely the reviewer's fault. I can only imagine how many hundreds (thousands?) of books come pouring into Kirkus' offices each week. Overwhelmed by this onslaught, our reviewer must have breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing Senator Torricelli's name on the cover of "IN OUR OWN WORDS," figuring it's a safe assumption that any collection of speeches edited by a prominent Democrat must be politically biased. After a brief skim through the table of contents, our overworked reviewer picked out a few examples to buttress his or her pre-conceived notion of the book and quickly tapped out the review. I will be the first to admit it makes for a lively and provocative article. Just not, alas, an accurate one.</p></p><h2>Empires of the monsoon: A history of the Indian Ocean and its invaders</h2><p>&#39;A triumph: a first class comprehensive narrative of the impact upon the people of the Indian Ocean of those who penetrated it. It is hard to believe that this account of a European epic has any rival.&#39; J.M. ROBERTS, author of the Penguin History of the World Until Vasco da Gama discovered the sea-route to the East in 1497-9 almost nothing was known in the West of the exotic cultures and wealth of the Indian Ocean and its peoples. It is this civilisation and its destruction at the hands of the West that Richard Hall recreates in this book. Hall&#39;s history of the exploration and exploitation -- by Chinese and Arab travellers, and by the Portuguese, Dutch and British alike -- is one of brutality, betrayal and colonial ambition. It is history told with the true gift of a storyteller and a keen eye for the exotic. It is a compelling and instructive epic.</p><p>Richard Hall is a distinguished journalist and writer. He was born in 1925 and spent his childhood in Australia and England. During the Second World War he served as a rating in a destroyer before going to Oxford to read English. He spent ten years in Africa as a newspaper editor and foreign correspondent and was the last journalist out of Biafra at the end of the Nigerian Civil War. He is the author of many books including a biography of the explorer Henry Stanley and a history of Zambia. After returning from Africa he became editor of the Observer&#39;s colour magazine and a columnist for the Financial Times. He owns and manages a company called Africa Analysis and lives in Oxfordshire.`Empires of the Monsoon is a panoramic study of the history of the Indian Ocean and the destruction of its traditional trade by colonial Europe... Its major achievement is to weave into a coherent whole the histories of a kaleidoscope of civilisations and peoples... Empires of the Monsoon reads like some mediaeval Book of Wonders, rich with exotic improbabilities... . It is all gripping stuff, dizzily ambitious in its scope and full of some of the oddest facts imaginable.&#39;William Dalrymple, Independent `Empires of the Monsoon is an example of popular history at its best... It is the story of many marvels and many great adventures.&#39;J.D.F. Jones, Financial Times `A panoramic account of the Indian Ocean and its invaders... combining scholarly zeal with a good journalist&#39;s flair for selection and narrative. The book is full of fascinating information.&#39;John Grigg, Sunday Telegraph `Hall&#39;s lively compendium is rich in bloodthirsty sultans, swashbuckling pirates, hypocritical imperialists and serendipitous Sinbads... He is an enthusiastic storyteller who can hold you with his glittering eye.&#39;Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, Sunday Times `A vast and fascinating history... I found it both absorbing and instructive.&#39;Robert Carver, Scotsman</p><h2>How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?</h2><p><b>Book Description:</b><br> Mother and child ponder the different ways a dinosaur can say goodnight, from slamming his tail and pouting to giving a big hug and kiss.<br><br>Featuring ten sleepy dinosaurs, this adorable picture book from prize-winning writer Jane Yolen and best-selling illustrator Mark Teague celebrates the funny, endearing, naughty bedtime behavior of young children... and young dinosaurs.<br><br>Tuck your child in and snuggle up for a bedtime story as the ten dinosaur children of this New York Times bestseller tell you how they say goodnight.

The innovative Aluminaire House that he developed together with A. L. Kocher was exhibited in 1932 by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in the legendary show in the Museum of Modern Art in New York &#34;The International Style: Architecture since 1922&#34; as one of the very few American examples of the movement. Soon after, Frey discovered the California desert, where he would settle and complete his most substantial works. Throughout his life, Frey was interested in finding new ways of building, as well as working with and doing research on prefabricated materials, the results of which he regularly published. With visionary talent, Frey built elegant, clearly structured residential houses and was the founder of the &#34;desert modernism&#34; style.Every book in &#34;Taschen&#39;s Basic Architecture Series&#34; features: approximately 120 images, including photographs, sketches, drawings, and floor plans; introductory essays exploring the architect&#39;s life and work, touching on family and background as well as collaborations with other architects; the most important works presented in chronological order, with descriptions of client and/or architect wishes as well as construction problems and resolutions; and, an appendix including a list of complete or selected works, biography, bibliography and a map indicating the locations of the architect&#39;s most famous buildings.</p><p>Gloria Koenig is an architectural historian and author.

To realize those good intentions, try organizing them with fashion designer and author Carolyne Roehm's <i>Summer Notebook</i>. Or, if your creative fields lie fallow once in a while (and whose don't?), borrow the seed of an idea from Roehm, who broadcasts her favorites for everyone's benefit.<p> This is a notebook (complete with grid paper for planning, lined pages for notes, and pouches for clippings), garden-design and flower color-combination guide, garden journal, recipe book--in essence, it's an idea book, a place to record your ideas and learn from Roehm's. The grounds of her Connecticut home, Weatherstone, serve as the canvas for her botanical muse. In the course of showing off her gardening victories, as well as admitting to her failures, we get chapters on Roehm's potager, inspired by Louis XIV's geometrically laid-out kitchen garden at Versailles; her quest for the perfect perennial border; the extreme state of her hydrangea envy and rose obsession; details of a Fourth of July celebration and a summer wedding held at Weatherstone; odes to peaches, corn, and tomatoes; and an "end paper" on the dread Japanese beetle. </p><p> All this, along with abundant color photos, recipes, floral-arrangement tips, and helpful hints like how to make your own floral preservative, make this inaugural installment in the Notebook series (Fall is next, of course) a unique addition to any avid gardener's library. <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i></p>Carolyne Roehm, noted author and lifestyle contributor to Good Morning America, brings her gardening expertise to viewers weekly as the host of Country Homes, Country Gardens.<p>In 1991, Roehm, who had always taken great pleasure in indulging and surrounding herself with things she loved, decided to turn her personal passion for beauty and comfort into a fulfilling career. A longtime associate (and neighbor) of famed couturier, Oscar de la Renta, Roehm began her own fashion business, setting her designs apart from many others in the industry with her unflagging insistence on only the finest quality materials. Her designs quickly found a home with discriminating consumers, as her first year alone saw revenues exceeding $3 million. But Roehm's passion for beauty extended beyond the world of fashion, and she became determined to broaden her horizons accordingly.</p><p>Following a stint at the famed Paris flower shop, Moulie Savart, Roehm took the knowledge she gained there and put it into practical use for the everyday gardener. Resulting from her considerable experience, she takes great joy in revealing the many secrets she learned to help everyone achieve a bountiful and beautiful garden.</p><p>In 1997, Roehm published her first book, A Passion for Flowers (September 1997, HarperCollins Publishers) in which she detailed the experts' tricks to perfect gardening. A firm believer in luxury for everyone, Roehm feels that luxury doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Her breathtaking floral arrangements, for example, traditionally contain many common flowers such as carnations, marigolds, bleeding hearts, and Queen Anne's lace, which she collects from her own garden at her Connecticut home.</p><p>Roehm applies the fashion lessons she learned to her flowers. The familiar cry of "accessorize" is as important to arranging blooms as it is to one's own appearance. "I can't tell you how often I've seen a dress ruined with the wrong accessories," Roehm explains. "It's the same with flowers. Even the most beautiful flowers don't work if they're in the wrong vase or placed against the wrong background."</p></p><h2>Southern as a Second Language: A Novel (Dixie Series)</h2><p><p>Not only do Southerners talk slowly, but sometimes the whole language is hard to understand.

I mean, what in the world was I supposed to tell Riley, my agitating next-door neighbor, when he rang my doorbell one October morning and asked if he could work at my brand-new restaurant as Peter&#x2019;s sous chef? My mind raced in a thousand directions and my initial thought was to say, &#x201c;That is so nice, Riley. I tell you what, though, I&#x2019;ll need to talk to Peter about this and get back with you.&#x201d; At the very least, it would have taken the onus off me. But just as I was about to open my mouth, my peripheral vision caught a glimpse of Kissie standing in the doorway leading from the dining room to the kitchen with hands firmly planted on her hips, mouth drawn tightly, and her head shaking from side to side. That was her not-so-subtle way of telling me that what I was about to do was a big fat no-no. She knew me all too well. <br>I knew she was right, but it&#x2019;s hard for me to be brutally honest with people, especially guys like Riley. I feel sorry for him, bless his heart. He&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; well, he&#x2019;s pitiful really, and he can&#x2019;t help it. He speaks with a soft <i>r,</i> so when you first meet him you think his name is Wiley. Wiley Bwadshaw. Kissie, on the other hand, doesn&#x2019;t feel in the least bit sorry for him. She says he&#x2019;s just plain annoying and that his speech impediment has nothing to do with it. She says there&#x2019;s no reason to feel bad for him. &#x201c;He gotta plenty money, a full head a hair, nice stature, and two strong legs to find honest work. There ain&#x2019;t no reason in the world to feel sorry for that man.&#x201d; <br>As he stood on my front stoop wearing a white apron and a chef&#x2019;s hat with RILEY embroidered in black, he tried selling himself. &#x201c;Working as a Pampa&#x2019;ed Chef Consultant qualifies me as a pewfect candidate for the sous chef position.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought you gave up Pampered Chef for Amway,&#x201d; I told him, still not having invited him in. Kissie would rather spend an entire afternoon behind a shopping cart with a bad wheel than five minutes face-to-face with Riley. <br>&#x201c;Actually, I did, but I&#x2019;ve weconsidered my decision and I&#x2019;m back in business. Anyway, these days,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;PCCs have to do cooking shows as part of the job.&#x201d; Riley adjusted the tie around his waist and it was then that I noticed the lettering on the front of his apron: THE PAMPERED CHEF� DISCOVER THE CHEF IN YOU. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve alweady hosted close to seven cooking demonstwations featuring the Pampa&#x2019;ed Chef&#x2019;s best thirty-minute wecipes.&#x201d; <br>I stood silently in my doorway trying my best to be polite, bobbing my head with a kind note of approval. Quite honestly, at this point, my neck was beginning to hurt. <br>He went on. &#x201c;That alone is another benefit, as I could make a huge diffewence in the efficiency of your westauwant opewation.&#x201d; An ear-to-ear smile spread across his face as he popped his index finger in my direction. &#x201c;And here&#x2019;s the best part, you could stock your kitchen exclusively with all Pampa&#x2019;ed Chef pwoducts, declaring the Peach Blossom Inn the first all-PC westauwant in Tennessee. Hey, you could even put a PC logo on the fwont door, as well as on all your menus, boasting that you are the first!&#x201d; He further added that that one detail alone was sure to increase our foot traffic by at least 75 percent&#x2014;given the Pampered Chef reputation and all. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a win&#x2013;win!&#x201d; Riley exclaimed as he snapped his fingers in the air and poked his head inside the entryway of my rental home, scanning his eyes from side to side. Riley&#x2019;s thirst for information could never be considered his strong suit. <br>Not only is Riley a Pampered Chef salesman (&#x201c;consultant&#x201d; is his word) but he &#x201c;reps&#x201d; Tupperware, Cutco, and of course, Amway, too. Kissie says that line of work is meant for women only and that he&#x2019;s flat-out embarrassing himself, but as he puts it, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gweat way to meet the ladies.&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t help but feel sorry for him there, too, because he&#x2019;s in his late thirties, still a bachelor, and sports a military hairdo to boot. His cropped brown hair ripples in the back when he bends his head down, but he keeps a two-inch flattop growth on the top. When you go into his home, he&#x2019;ll show you around the house but you can&#x2019;t sit on the furniture. It&#x2019;s covered in plastic. So are the rugs. In fact, there&#x2019;s a see-through runner that extends all over the house. The one time I had to go over there to borrow an egg and made mention of the vast amount of Tupperware products in his kitchen, he swept his hand over the coated furniture in the den and said, &#x201c;Well, how do you think I got all this? Nevah, my dear lady, unda&#x2019;estimate the powa&#x2019; of plastic.&#x201d; <br>So instead of putting off the inevitable and saying that I&#x2019;d ask Peter about the sous chef position and get back with him, I took Kissie&#x2019;s body language into account, mustered all my courage, and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so nice of you to ask about that, Riley, but Peter already has a sous chef.&#x201d; It was technically a lie, I realize that, but I like to think of it as a harmless little fib meant to spare his feelings. <br>The news seemed to take him by surprise. &#x201c;Oh. Well, hmmm. I didn&#x2019;t wealize you had alweady hired someone.&#x201d; The creases in Riley&#x2019;s forehead deepened as he considered his options. <br>I didn&#x2019;t say a word. &#x201c;The less said the better,&#x201d; as Mama used to say, a quote she often borrowed from Jane Austen. <i>Emma,</i> I think it was. <br>&#x201c;Never mind, then,&#x201d; he said, disappointment in his voice. &#x201c;Well, good luck with your new hire.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Riley. Talk to you soon.&#x201d; I backed behind the door and waved as I slowly pushed it to. <br>With relief oozing from my pores, I bolted the lock and turned around in a rush, bumping noses with Kissie. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you go and tell him that for?&#x201d; she asked in her indignant tone of voice, the one she&#x2019;s become famous for&#x2014;at least in my mind. Her right hand alternated between pointing her finger in the air and resting on her large hip. &#x201c;He gone find out the truth as soon as you put an ad in the newspaper, <i>hm hm hm, hm hm hm.</i> Lawd knows that man reads every word in it. Even the circulars.&#x201d; Kissie chants little <i>hm</i>s when she&#x2019;s disgusted at something or someone. She also does a variation of it when she&#x2019;s happy. This was not one of those. <br>I sighed loudly. Shifting my weight from one foot to the other, I reached around and knotted my long, curly (ofttimes frizzy) red hair into a bun, something I do whenever I&#x2019;m nervous. Or whenever Kissie is about to lecture me. I really and truly thought what I said was just the kindest thing. &#x201c;But this way I won&#x2019;t hurt his feelings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That may be, but in the long run, your fib gone get you in trouble. And even if you get out of that tall tale, what you gone say about outfitting your new restaurant with all Pampered Chef products?&#x201d; Now both hands were back on her hips. &#x201c;He ain&#x2019;t gone stop there neither. He&#x2019;ll want you to use Cutco, Tupperware, and Amway, too. Wait and see if ol&#x2019; Kissie ain&#x2019;t right. He&#x2019;s over there thinking he&#x2019;s hit the jackpot. You better nip this in the bud while you still can.&#x201d; After enduring eight months of maddening encounters with my meddlesome next-door neighbor, my other mother was flat done. <br>From the very first day I rented the house, Riley had had &#x201c;his nose in our business,&#x201d; as Kissie put it. She&#x2019;d do almost anything to avoid him, including drawing the curtains in the middle of the day to give the impression no one was home. Incidentally, Kissie had been giving me &#x201c;the look&#x201d; with her hands on her hips since the day I learned to walk. And she was continuing the tradition with my two little girls. Clearly a person&#x2019;s age had nothing to do with it. I was just short of thirty-six, but to Kissie, age was irrelevant. <br>Twenty minutes later when two consecutive doorbell chimes interrupted our morning a second time, Roberta, my little two-year-old mutt my girls and I found at the pound, hurled himself into a barking frenzy. After sticking him in the kitchen so he wouldn&#x2019;t run off down the street once I opened the door, two more chimes had followed in the space it took me to make it to the foyer. This not only got Roberta going again, but Kissie&#x2014;who was taking what she called &#x201c;a breather&#x201d; to watch Saturday-morning cartoons with my Sarah and Isabella&#x2014;sprang out of her seat (she&#x2019;s nearly eighty-four) and beat me to the entrance hall. She knew exactly who was on the other side. &#x201c;May I help you, Riley?&#x201d; I heard her say while flinging the door open. Her voice could possibly pass for polite but there was not a bit of a happy-to-see-you lilt in it at all. <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Kissie. May I talk to Leelee again?&#x201d; Riley, on the other hand, was exuberant. <br>&#x201c;All right. Leelee,&#x201d; she hollered behind her, with <i>no</i> enthusiasm, &#x201c;Riley&#x2019;s back.&#x201d; <br>I strolled up and shyly peered over her shoulder. Panic about my fib had started to take root. <br>This time Riley wore one of his black sweatshirts with TUPPERWARE ROCKS embroidered in large red letters clear across the front. Until meeting Riley, I had no earthly idea that Tupperware clothing even existed. &#x201c;Hi again.&#x201d; He waved at the two of us. &#x201c;I just had a bwilliant idea.&#x201d; Riley&#x2019;s enthusiasm was made obvious by the way he rocked back and forth on his heels. &#x201c;I was just looking awound my kitchen when the thought popped in my head that the Peach Blossom Inn will have all kinds of food-stowage needs. I could stock your kitchen with any kind of Tuppa&#x2019;ware pwoduct you could possibly imagine. And Kissie, you could host the pawty!&#x201d; He reached into his back pocket and handed her a rolled-up Tupperware catalog. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe the kinds of wewards you can earn. Why I&#x2019;ve nearly outfitted my entire house.&#x201d; <br>Awkwardness hung heavy in the air. Hosting a Tupperware party would be the last thing eighty-three-and-a-half-year-old Kissie King would ever add to her bucket list. Just as I was pondering another little white lie to relieve us all of this misery, Riley piped up again. &#x201c;And wait till you learn about the sharp world of Cutc&#x2014;&#x201d; The daggers in Kissie&#x2019;s eyes could have cut that poor thing&#x2019;s face in half. As for me, I just stood there expressionless, not knowing what to say. Riley backed down the steps and onto the walkway. &#x201c;Uh, why don&#x2019;t you take your time and think about it; I&#x2019;ll get back with you later.&#x201d; <br>Kissie put her hand on the back of the door and shoved. &#x201c;Sure, Riley,&#x201d; I said before it swung shut. <br>Even though I didn&#x2019;t want to, I met Kissie&#x2019;s glare straight on. I&#x2019;d seen it a thousand times. Tight, pursed lips with eyebrows arched like upside-down crescent moons and coal black eyes staring right into mine. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say a word,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I knew you were right the minute I heard the second doorbell chime.&#x201d; As she turned and ambled back to the den to join the girls, a peeved &#x201c;hm hm hm&#x201d; was the only sound she made. <br>Kissie is one of the loveliest people who ever lived. It&#x2019;s just that Riley crawls all over her. She puts it like this: &#x201c;Sometimes that man sits on my last raw nerve.&#x201d; As irritated as he makes her, though, she doesn&#x2019;t stay that way long. In fact, she spends much more of her time laughing than glaring. If she finds something funny&#x2014;anything at all&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll tee-hee herself into a full-blown laughing attack quicker than anyone I know. Tears will stream from her eyes and pretty soon her entire face looks like she just stepped out of the shower. The sound of her laughter is the most contagious thing you&#x2019;ve ever heard and it&#x2019;s virtually impossible not to join right in with her. When she&#x2019;s finished&#x2014;with the laughing attack, that is&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll end by saying, &#x201c;oh me,&#x201d; or, &#x201c;oooh-wee,&#x201d; however the mood strikes her. <br>Without question, she&#x2019;s the most wonderful person I&#x2019;ve ever known, and that&#x2019;s been since the day I was born. My grandparents shared her with Mama and Daddy the minute I popped into the world. She was considered one of the best cateresses in Memphis when Granddaddy stumbled upon her at a cocktail party. He popped one of Kissie&#x2019;s cheese dreams in his mouth and knew he had to hire her. She cooked for them for ten years before I was born and all of a sudden she was both a chef and a nanny. Times were different then. Many families had a black lady working in the home. Some had a cook, a maid, and an ironing lady. Not many, but a few. Mama and Daddy had a maid who doubled as an ironing lady and a superb cook. And I had a black mama. <br>Sometimes I&#x2019;m surprised she stayed with us. Mama had a tendency to be jealous of my affection for Kissie. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, the reason for that is as simple as two plus two. Kissie was the one taking care of me. Running my bath, cleaning my behind, and making sure my tummy was full; kissing my elbows and knees when I fell off my bike and bundling me up in the winter. Kissie worked in our home <i>at least</i> five days a week. Children bond to their caregivers whether they are blood or not, and that&#x2019;s exactly what happened with me. I fell in love with Kissie King like she was my own mother. <br>There was never a birthday party where Kissie didn&#x2019;t do most of the work or a dance recital when Kissie didn&#x2019;t help me get ready. Of course, Mama helped. I would be remiss if I didn&#x2019;t give her part of the credit. I know she tried. But something else in her life seemed to always claim the front seat. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>My white eyelet dress with Juliet sleeves and an empire waist came from Goldsmith&#x2019;s, Memphis&#x2019;s hometown department store. The cutest thing I&#x2019;d ever seen and just perfect for my first Junior Cotillion dance. Mama took me shopping and I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get back home to try it on for Kissie. Since I attended an all-girls school and Junior Cotillion was an all-girls organization, I had to invite my own date. All year my eyes had been set on Danny Weaver, a boy from the boys&#x2019; school down the street. Sandy blond hair, a spray of freckles across his nose, big blue eyes&#x2014;I had set my sights high. From the moment I spotted him at my first boy&#x2013;girl party one year earlier, I pictured us a couple.</i> <br> <i>Calling him on the phone, God as my witness, took five years off my life. It was a Friday afternoon; I&#x2019;ll never forget it. I&#x2019;d never called a boy before and as an eighth-grader with no brothers, I was scared to death to dial the number. His mother answered the phone and with Mary Jule, one of my three best friends, sitting right next to me, I said, &#x201c;May I please speak to Danny?&#x201d; That was just before the days of caller ID and I could have hung up right then and there if I wanted to but Mary Jule held my hand and urged me to &#x201c;just get it over with.&#x201d; Once he said hello, Danny sat there on the other end of the line, barely saying anything until I finally blurted out the question. After an excruciating pause, he finally said yes but hurried off the phone. It&#x2019;s a wonder I survived.</i> <br> <i>The night of the formal, Kissie helped to straighten my hair and made sure my dress was pressed. Of course, Mama took all the pictures once Danny picked me up at the door, and that was an even more uncomfortable moment, since it was seven o&#x2019;clock by the time he got there and, well, that&#x2019;s two hours past five. Without fail, no matter what day of the week it was, cocktail hour in our house commenced with the five o&#x2019;clock whistle.</i> <br> <i>The evening could scarcely be described as romantic. Once we got to the dance, the girls clustered around the tables while the boys huddled around one another at the far end of the room, no doubt talking about basketball, football, or who knows what else. It could have been my curly-turned-straight red hair, for all I knew; it was and still is the bane of my existence. The parental chaperones urged us to dance but Danny and the rest of the boys just sat there like toads, never uttering a word. Four hours later Danny and I slithered into the backseat of his father&#x2019;s Lincoln Continental for the long ride home.

But that's exactly what Tommy Burwell was doing, even though he wasn't smart enough to know better. Even though "South of Heaven" is another term for hell.<br><br>Combining a tale of escalating savagery with a dead-eyed group portrait of men at the edge, Jim Thompson has produced a masterpiece of the American dissolute.</p><p>(1906 - 1977) James Meyers Thompson was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma. He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>Hebrews, Volume 1 (Works of John Owen, Volume 17)</h2><p><p><strong>The Crossway Classic Commentaries</strong></p> <p>Original works by godly writers, tailored for the understanding of today's reader</p> <p>For hundreds of years Christendom has been blessed with Bible commentaries written by great men of God who were highly respected for their godly walk and their insight into spiritual truth. The&nbsp;Crossway Classic Commentaries series, carefully adapted for maximum understanding and usefulness, presents the very best work on individual Bible books for today's believers.</p> <p>The author of Hebrews wanted his audience to know and understand one truth: Christ is superior, and therefore, so is Christianity. He demonstrates this by comparing the imperfect old covenant with the perfect new covenant. The person of Christ is better than prophets and angels, His priesthood is greater than that of Melchizedek and the line of Aaron, and His power within the believer's life is incomparable. Between these contrasts he exhorts the readers to persevere in their faith, be obedient, grow in their understanding, and not miss the grace of God. The lessons and admonitions of Hebrews have intensely practical application for all readers&#x2014;then and now.</p> <p>John Owens' unveiling of this text will give pastors and students of the Bible a thorough handle on its key passages. The message of Hebrews proves that Jesus Christ is still the Savior the world needs today. Contemporary believers will be inspired by it as they seek to uphold and defend Christ's supremacy in a pluralistic world.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Owen</strong>&nbsp;(1616&#x2013;1683) was vice chancellor of Oxford University and served as advisor and chaplain to Oliver Cromwell.

Originally a doctoral dissertation undertaken by the author at the University of Kansas, now supplemented with new chapters, and with hundreds of maps and illustrations. &#34;Saharasia&#34; is scarsely known to the wider public, given the controversial conclusions which precipitated from its development. But its findings, made as early as 1980, have been validated repeatedly by subsequent scientific discovery, and by world events. The new edition contains all-new Appendix documentation: &#34;Update on Saharasia&#34; reviewing archaeological evidence suggestive of an ancient period of generally peaceful human social conditions, world-wide.</p><p>Ancient humans were peaceful - modern violence is avoidable. That&#39;s the basic message contained in &#34;Saharasia&#34;, a controversial &#34;marriage of heresies&#34; over 10 years in the making. It will change forever your way of looking at the world, your home culture, and current events. Saharasia constitutes a revolutionary new discovery on a geographic pattern to global human behavior as deeply embedded within the scientific literature of anthropology, history and archaeology. It covers issues and events which typically are ignored in the &#34;politically correct&#34; academic environment, even though it was produced within that same environment. Saharasia presents the first cross-cultural, anthropological, archaeological and historical survey of human family and social institutions, tracing human violence back in time to specific times and places of first-origin. Saharasia also presents an additional controversy, given the factual identity of the violence-prone Saharasian region to be the homeland of the Islamo-fascist terror brigades. Saharasia has at several times in human history been the region from which massive armies marched out to conquer those moister regions lying at its periphery: into Europe, China, India and sub-Saharan Africa. These would be the early Indo-Aryan, Kurgan and Battle-Axe warriors, the Scythians and Huns, the Mongols, Turks, and Arab-Muslims, all of whom formed gigantic empires encompassing desert Saharasia and parts of its moister borderlands. While the analysis contained in this book starts around 12,000 BC and ends at around 1900 AD, the suggestion is clear, that the modern problem of global terrorism also springs forth from basic Saharasian-warrior roots. If you really want to know why so much of the world is in such a miserable condition, and to fully understand the current &#34;march to war&#34; within Islamic nations, this book will provide answers.</p><h2>Twentynine Palms: A True Story of Murder, Marines, and the Mojave</h2><p>The gruesome true story of a troubled Marine with a long history of sexual violence profiles Valentine Underwood, who murdered two young women in a small town in the Mojave Desert, and provides a searing examination of a military culture and its code of silence.</p><p>Deanne Stillman is a former columnist for <i>Buzz Magazine</i>. Her writing has also appeared in the <i>New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, GQ, Village Voice,</i> and on-line publications <i>Salon</i> and <i>Slate.</i> Her article in Los Angeles Magazine, upon which this book is based, won the 1996 Maggie Award for Best News Story. Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, she now lives in Los Angeles, California.The image of a disconnected phone recurs throughout Stillman's tale of social and geographic isolation, military arrogance, sexual violence and death an apt symbol for the disconnections pervading the story. Unfortunately, the metaphor also extends to Stillman's narrative, which signals the plumbing of certain depths, but never makes the connections. The small California town of Twentynine Palms in the Mojave Desert, three hours east of Los Angeles, hosts the world's largest U.S. Marine Corps base. In 1991, it was the setting for the vicious murder of two local teenage girls by a troubled marine. Stillman's story primarily follows Debie McMaster, mother of one of the victims and no stranger to violence herself. Against the desert backdrop described with poetic and geologic detail Stillman examines military life and the surrounding subculture, focusing on jittery soldiers trolling for susceptible young women, themselves desperate for a way out. But exhaustive family histories and a fragmented structure undermine the story's inherent drama. Moreover, Stillman neither affords much insight into the killer's motivations, nor adequately explores the military atmosphere that allowed him to thrive. To her credit, she approaches the hand-to-mouth existence typical of Twentynine Palms with a certain aplomb, but too often the prose becomes crowded with the vernaculars of the subcultures it describes. Stillman, who first reported on this story for Los Angeles Magazine, also treads the fine journalistic line between fact and conjecture. She devotes considerable attention to the protagonists' inner workings and, though endnotes cite her sources, the reader is left wondering about her apparently extraordinary access to these people.

From Israel to India to Canada, Tsabari&#x2019;s indelible characters grapple with love, violence, faith, the slipperiness of identity, and the challenges of balancing old traditions with modern times. <br><br> These eleven spellbinding stories often focus on Israel&#x2019;s Mizrahi Jews, featuring mothers and children, soldiers and bohemians, lovers and best friends, all searching for their place in the world.

I stop walking, pull my squished cigarette pack out from the back pocket of my jeans, tap it and dig out a half--smoked cigarette. Then I lean against the stone wall behind me and light it.<br><br> Downtown Jerusalem is busy at midday. Cars creep along the congested street, music pouring out from their open windows. The narrow sidewalks&#x2014;made narrower by the goods overflowing from the storefronts&#x2014;are swarming with people, lugging bags from the Mahane Yehuda Market.&nbsp;Orthodox high-school girls in long skirts saunter by me, giggling when they pass three young soldiers with kippahs on their heads, M-16s slung over their shoulders. Across the street, a group of pink-faced tourists&#x2014;probably Christian pilgrims who have disregarded the warnings against traveling to Israel in these dangerous times&#x2014;take photos of themselves next to an unremarkable alley. Natalie is hidden and revealed in intervals, glimpsed in the gaps between the vehicles and faces, through bus windows, a choppy sequence of still images, like a stop-motion video.<br><br> It&#x2019;s been seven years since I last saw her. After we broke up&#x2014;and by broke up, I mean she ripped my heart out of my chest and stomped on it with both feet&#x2014;she sort of disappeared. She lost touch with all of the friends we had back then. No one knew where she lived or what she was up to. No one ever ran into her. She was just gone.<br><br> I flick my cigarette butt on the asphalt, my eyes trying to register what they see, my brain slow to compute. At first I try to convince myself that it doesn&#x2019;t mean what I think it means. Of course she would look different. She&#x2019;s thirty-five now, no longer the twentysomething Natalie from my memories, with the thick black curls she used to braid with shells and beads, the flimsy wrap skirts she had brought from India, the tie-dyed halter tops that exposed her delicate, jutting shoulder blades. There must be a perfectly good reason&#x2014;other than the obvious&#x2014;why she&#x2019;d be covering her hair, wearing a skirt down to her ankles and a long--sleeved shirt on a summer day. Orthodox women don&#x2019;t usually wear glittery and bohemian-looking scarves like that as a head scarf, don&#x2019;t let strands of hair fall out on the sides. They definitely don&#x2019;t look that smoking hot in clothes designed to make them invisible to men like me.<br><br> A part of me wants to walk away, pretend I haven&#x2019;t seen her, keep my memory of her undisturbed. But then a businessman jaywalks into traffic while speaking loudly into his phone, setting off a series of honks and yells, and Natalie looks up at the commotion, and her gaze wanders over and fixes on me. I&#x2019;ve been staring for so long that I&#x2019;ve almost forgotten she can see me too. Her face broadens in surprise, then brightens. She extends her arm for a wave. I cross the street, wishing I had shaved this morning.<br><br> &#x201c;Lior.&#x201d; She stands up, her eyes glinting like two spoons. We don&#x2019;t hug, the space between us thick with past embraces, with a history of touching.<br><br> &#x201c;Wow, Natalie, you&#x2019;re&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Dossit,&#x201d; she completes my sentence, smiling as if she&#x2019;s swallowed sunshine.<br><br> &#x201c;This is huge,&#x201d; I say, and she laughs. I quickly give&nbsp;her the once-over: her skirt is embroidered with flowers at the hem, her shirt is a vintage tunic with a floral print. Of course, she&#x2019;s a hippie-dossit: one of those cool New Age -Orthodox Jews&#x2014;often former Tel Avivians&#x2014;who found God but didn&#x2019;t lose their chic. &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; I stroke the stubble on my chin. &#x201c;I had no idea.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Seven years now. Baruch Hashem.&#x201d; She gazes up. God bless.<br><br> &#x201c;Seven years,&#x201d; I repeat. Right after we broke up.<br><br> &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re shocked now you should have seen me then.&#x201d; She laughs again. &#x201c;I was much stricter in the beginning. I had myself covered from head to toe.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No kidding,&#x201d; I say. My mind is struggling to reconstruct the past seven years, replace the set of imaginary lives I&#x2019;d created for her in my head. An ashram in the desert, a commune in the Galilee, a temple in India. Never this.<br><br> &#x201c;Your hair,&#x201d; she says with a quick jerk of her chin.<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I rub my shaved head, the smooth patch in the middle I&#x2019;m grateful she can&#x2019;t see. &#x201c;All gone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You look good like that.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re married.&#x201d; I gesture at the head scarf.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Her smile seems to fade a little. &#x201c;Remember Gadi?&#x201d;<br><br> I frown.<br><br> &#x201c;Sure you do. He was in my Judaism class in university.&#x201d;<br><br> Natalie used to complain about being forced to take Judaism classes as a part of the curriculum at Bar-Ilan University. Gadi&#x2014;an American who had moved from New York to find his inner Jew&#x2014;came over to our house a couple of times to help her study.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been married for six years now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s like she&#x2019;s dug her fingernail into a scab, unearthing an old wound. Fucking Gadi. I knew he was trying to get into her pants. Natalie said I was crazy.<br><br> &#x201c;It was after we broke up,&#x201d; she quickly adds.<br><br> I nod and smile because I don&#x2019;t know what else to do. &#x201c;And kids? You probably have a troop by now.&#x201d; By the way her face crumbles, tightens around the lips, I know I&#x2019;ve asked the wrong question. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say.<br><br> Her tan cheeks turn burgundy. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br><br> We both look away. I use the opportunity to scan the patio, which I would have done earlier had I not been distracted. A couple holding hands over a half-eaten Greek salad, a young mother rocking a stroller with one hand while flipping through a magazine with the other, an old man bent over a notebook, two female soldiers sharing a cigarette. One of them glances at me, sizing me up. We are all trained to identify potential threats.<br><br> &#x201c;So what are you doing in Jerusalem?&#x201d; Natalie asks.<br><br> &#x201c;House-sitting in Ein Kerem.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Alone?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I slide my hands into my pockets and hike up my jeans. &#x201c;My girlfriend stayed in Tel Aviv. Listen, can I join you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually, I was just leaving.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a public place,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;re in a closed room or anything.&#x201d;<br><br> She glances around the patio, checks her phone and finally says, &#x201c;Why not? A cup of coffee. It&#x2019;s been so long.&#x201d;<br><br> I slide into the chair opposite her and she heads to the washroom. I follow her with my gaze, the outline of her hips against her skirt. Shelly, the young waitress-slash-film student whom I met here earlier this week shakes her head at me with a smile.<br><br> Natalie and I were twenty-two when we met. We had both just moved to Tel Aviv, me from the suburbs, her from a kibbutz in the Galilee. We worked at the same bar on Sheinkin&#x2014;back when Sheinkin was the place to be&#x2014;saving money for the big trip after the army. We fell in love like you do in your twenties, drowning into each other, blending until the boundaries of our selves blurred.<br> It was the nineties: the Gulf War was over, Rabin was elected prime minister and everyone thought peace was possible, and that soon we&#x2019;d be partying in Beirut, eating hummus in Damascus and driving along the Mediterranean coast to Turkey. Tel Aviv was just gaining a reputation for being a party capital&#x2014;ir lelo hafsaka&#x2014;the city that never stops, and magazines in London and New York began covering its nightlife, including it on lists for the best clubs, the best beaches. Natalie and I rented an apartment on Shalom Aleichem, not too far from the beach, with old painted tile floors and a rounded white balcony, which we decorated with furniture we found by dumpsters. We smoked sandy grass from Egypt in bongs that we had bought at a twenty-four-hour kiosk, had sex in the washrooms of bars, and sat at a beach restaurant at four in the morning drinking hot water with mint leaves and eating hummus between swims in the dark, velvety waters of the Mediterranean. On weekends we hitched rides to trance parties in forests and did ecstasy, and on holidays we went to Sinai, slept in a straw hut by the sea and played backgammon with the Bedouins. We felt like we were a part of a generation, and that life had been made just for us and we&#x2019;d never be sick and never grow old and nothing bad would ever happen to us. Now, more than a decade later, Rabin is dead after being assassinated at a peace rally; suicide bombers explode in buses and caf�s; our friends have all moved to the suburbs, bought apartments and had kids; Natalie is a married Orthodox and I&#x2019;m unemployed and dating a twenty-four-year-old.<br><br> We order coffee. Cappuccino for her, Turkish for me. I try not to stare but it&#x2019;s hard. Her face is the same, heart-shaped and smiling&#x2014;her default expression&#x2014;and her skin flawless, tiny wrinkles just starting by her eyes. Maybe it&#x2019;s my staring but she seems restless; she fiddles with everything on the table, her eyes darting around the patio. She checks her messages. &#x201c;Gadi is in New York till tomorrow,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;His mom is not doing so well.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you go? I&#x2019;d kill to get out of here right now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Work,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t get out of school. How about you? Still in computers?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually, the company just folded.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d; I flick my lighter on and off. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll move to New Zealand or something.&#x201d;<br><br> She laughs. &#x201c;And do what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, herd sheep?&#x201d;<br><br> She waves her hand. &#x201c;You love it here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not as much as I used to.&#x201d;<br><br> She studies the table. I squint up at the stone balconies hunched over the street, their wooden shutters crooked and blackened with car exhaust. I realize that things have changed, that there are certain topics we better not talk about, things we&#x2019;d probably never agree on. Our fathers&#x2019; right to this land, for one, which rules out both politics and religion, since in this country the two are joined in a suffocating embrace. But then again, we almost never talked about these things when we were together. We were pseudo-hippies; we wanted everyone to get along so we wouldn&#x2019;t feel guilty for the terrible things that were happening in the world while we made love not war.<br><br>Sometimes it&#x2019;s better not to know; it can make you crazy. On the way here I saw people huddling around the TV screen at a convenience store, the air around them rigid with alarm. Mouths open, heads shaking, tongues clucking. A pigua in Haifa, they said. Nine dead. I didn&#x2019;t bother to stop. The only advantage to knowing that there was a suicide bombing earlier today is that it makes me feel safer now. It&#x2019;s a warped logic, based in fear. You take what you can.<br><br> Natalie grabs a packet of brown sugar, rips the edge of it and dumps its contents into her cappuccino. She then spoons the sugary foam into her mouth just as it starts to melt. No stirring. I sip my coffee and hold back a smile. Some things never change.<br><br> &#x201c;So why are you really in Jerusalem?&#x201d; she asks, pulling the polished spoon out from between her dark lips.<br><br> I lean back in my seat. &#x201c;How much time do you have?&#x201d;<br><br> It has been a rough few months. Since the second intifada started, the entire country has been going through a midlife crisis: the economy crashed, the high-tech bubble burst, the hotels on the seawall emptied, their windows dark. When I was a teenager, the city was full of tourists; my friends and I used to hit on them on beaches, offering to help when we saw them carrying backpacks on street corners, fingers to maps.<br><br> While I avoided reading the newspapers or watching the news, carefully constructing a bubble in which I could function without losing my mind, my girlfriend, Efrat, pored over every page, was glued to the screen, the cold blue light washing over her face. She stopped using public transit, rarely went out, stayed away from the crowded, open Carmel Market, shopping instead at a smaller, pricier mini-market, where the produce wasn&#x2019;t as fresh but where no suicide bomber would waste his ammunition. It was as though she was in a perpetual state of waiting&#x2014;for the next news flash, the next bomb to explode, the next series of phone calls to friends and family to make sure no one had been hurt. On top of it all, the anxiety medication she had been prescribed reduced her sex drive to nil. When she refused to go out with me in the evenings, I went by myself, finding reasons to stay out later, pushing her out of my bubble&#x2014;my safe zone&#x2014;the gap between us widening.<br><br> Then, on my way back from my parents&#x2019; place I ran over a kitten. I was driving south on the right lane of Ayalon Highway, under bridges and overpasses, when I saw the little bugger&#x2014;its eyes like tiny headlights&#x2014;coming out of nowhere into my lane, as if on a suicide mission. I came to a screeching stop, turned my distress lights on and stepped outside. The kitten was splayed on the asphalt, not much bigger than my palm, mouth open in mid-scream, the blood still red and warm underneath it, its insides purple and pink and brown. He probably belonged to no one, another stray that would eat from garbage cans and one day impregnate another cat and make a litter of redundant kitties no one would ever give a shit about. But seeing it there, its blood soaking into the asphalt, something broke in me.<br><br> I drove home sobbing; the city&#x2019;s skyline loomed ahead, giant ads with skinny models draped on the sides of buildings. The radio played sad songs because there had been two attacks that day. I was sniffling and howling, snot and tears running down my chin. When I walked through the door, eyes red, face wet and wrinkled, Efrat jumped off the couch, a hand over her mouth. &#x201c;Oh my God. What happened?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I ran over a kitten,&#x201d; I said, and saying it aloud made me burst into another series of ugly, unmanly sobs.<br><br> &#x201c;A kitten?&#x201d; She stared at me, confused, then she tried touching me, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, baby,&#x201d; but I shook her off, shuffled into my office, played video games till two in the morning and smoked all of our grass.<br><br> I spent the following week in my sweatpants. I smoked too much pot, watched TV, slept into the afternoon. Outside our apartment, life went on, the city carried on its incessant buzzing, while I was frozen inside. Something was wrong. I realized that every step in our relationship had been initiated by Efrat, as if she was holding the road map and I was just tagging along. She asked to be monogamous; she suggested we move in together. I started to wonder: Now what? Was I supposed to be an adult? To know what I wanted? To marry Efrat? Have children? And some nights&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t tell Natalie this part&#x2014;I thought of her. Over the years, in her absence, she had become mythical. Every woman I&#x2019;d ever dated was required to fill her enormous shoes, and failed.<br><br> A friend was going away to India and needed someone to watch his house in Ein Kerem, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem&#x2014;more like a village, really&#x2014;where artists lived in old Arabic stone houses covered with vines. It was the end of summer, and Tel Aviv was steeped in its own juices, smelling of ripe garbage and swathed in dust and sand. Even the nights were sticky, offering no reprieve. I had been dreaming about getting away, wishing I could afford a flight somewhere. Anywhere. Jerusalem, with its dry air and cooler nights, was the closest thing to Europe.<br><br> Natalie is listening to everything without saying a word, nodding in the right ...</p><h2>The Reef Aquarium, Vol. 2: A Comprehensive Guide to the Identification and Care of Tropical Marine Invertebrates</h2><p>This second volume in the series features the anemones and soft corals associated with reefs, detailing their biology and husbandry requirements, and featuring numerous species descriptions, with the benefit of wonderful color photographs.

And parking? Don't bet on it unless you're in the fast lane of the Capital Beltway during rush hour.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that so many residents and visitors rely on the Washington Metro, the 106-mile rapid transit system that serves the District of Columbia and its inner suburbs. In the first comprehensive history of the Metro, Zachary M. Schrag tells the story of the Great Society Subway from its earliest rumblings to the present day, from Arlington to College Park, Eisenhower to Marion Barry. </p><p>Unlike the pre&#x2013;World War II rail systems of New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia, the Metro was built at a time when most American families already owned cars, and when most American cities had dedicated themselves to freeways, not subways. Why did the nation's capital take a different path? What were the consequences of that decision?</p><p>Using extensive archival research as well as oral history, Schrag argues that the Metro can be understood only in the political context from which it was born: the Great Society liberalism of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. The Metro emerged from a period when Americans believed in public investments suited to the grandeur and dignity of the world's richest nation. The Metro was built not merely to move commuters, but in the words of Lyndon Johnson, to create "a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community."</p><p>Schrag scrutinizes the project from its earliest days, including general planning, routes, station architecture, funding decisions, land-use impacts, and the behavior of Metro riders. The story of the Great Society Subway sheds light on the development of metropolitan Washington, postwar urban policy, and the promises and limits of rail transit in American cities.</p></p><p><p>As Metro stretches to Tysons Corner and beyond, this paperback edition features a new preface from the author.</p><p>Many residents and visitors rely on the Washington Metro, the rapid transit system that serves the District of Columbia and its suburbs.

She lives in Miami with her husband, two dogs, and too many cats.</p><b></b><p><b> Prologue </b> </p><p> She was all he desired but everything forbidden. </p><p> Her appeal was lethal. Her spirited steps, her laughter, each reckless toss of her shiny blond hair struck him like bullets to the heart. She had a way about her. And the body type that never failed to excite him. </p><p> By daylight she haunted him, materializing like an apparition in the supermarket, at the community center, or walking her dog. As he collected his mail or plucked his paper off the grass, he'd glimpse her face in a passing car. Wherever he went, she was there. </p><p> He thought of her the most when he was alone in the dark. </p><p> Fate was giving him the finger. That he knew. Led into temptation, he resisted. Why complicate his existence in this community of six thousand souls in neat frame houses with maple and pine trees standing like sentinels along streets that all led to nowhere? A bowling ball rolling down Main Street at 11 p.m. would not strike anyone. If he hungered for a late-night steak or burger he had a choice: stay hungry or learn to cook. </p><p> The huge flocks of Canada geese migrating overhead were another frequent frustration. Honking and flying, flying and honking, until all he wanted was to shotgun them out of the goddamn sky. The profound silence when they neither honked nor flew was even worse. He'd wake up alone in the night convinced he'd gone deaf in the dark. </p><p> His passion went unrequited, but he and the object of his attention did share rare moments: they nearly collided one Saturday morning as he browsed hangover remedies in an aisle at the Rite Aid Drugstore. Her megawatt smile deepened her killer dimples and crinkled her mischievous blue eyes. She obviously recognized him. </p><p> He whistled softly through his teeth as he watched her go. "You know what you just did to me," he whispered. </p><p> They always knew. </p><p> He fought his basic instincts, kept his profile low, and stuck to the rules -- some of them. He had a secret plan about to spin into play. Who could blame him? Bored to distraction, he missed the money, the sex, the power. Nightlife here revolved around a pizza joint that closed early and monthly church suppers at which participants prayed, no doubt to survive the inedibly gummy spaghetti dinner. </p><p> Sleepless, he paced his modest middle-class home like a caged and moody lion yearning for his natural habitat, a concrete jungle astir with the wild life and high-risk encounters among the creatures of the night. </p><p> During a routine physical his new doctor suggested that he smoke less and exercise more. They won't be satisfied, he thought bitterly, until I am stripped of every comfort and simple pleasure. Nonetheless, he began a regimen of brisk daily walks. Fresh air and exercise would keep him too busy for unhealthy obsessions. But soon her house became a major landmark on his route. She lived on the far side of a small park surrounding an imposing stone sculpture, a horseman wielding a raised sword. </p><p> He paused to read the plaque at its base. The inscription identified the rider: he was General John Stark, who led the New Hampshire Minutemen to battle in the Revolutionary War and coined the state's motto, Live Free or Die. He studied the horseman's face and his sword, then checked his watch and quickly moved on. His walks were synchronized with her schedule so he could see what she wore -- and didn't. How much more smooth, milky skin would she bare as the long, dreary days of winter began to yield to blindingly bright yellow daffodils? Unlike the stone-faced general, she exuded life and energy. He obsessed over the impatient jut of her hip, her merry laughter, and the graceful curve of her neck, exposed when she pinned her glowing hair back. They all fueled his fantasies. </p><p> Spontaneous and typically female, she was not always predictable, or inclement weather would intervene. Often he was disappointed, but when she was on her front porch, in the driveway, or her yard, it was worth the wait. Eventually, she began to acknowledge him with a look of recognition, then a smile, and most recently, a friendly wave. </p><p> He responded with a neighborly nod, nothing more. </p><p> He had been told to make friends. How do you do that in middle age, when all your previous friendships were forged and flourished in childhood? Friends grow up together, cover each other's backs, and build alliances through a lifetime of history shared back in the day. </p><p> An outsider here, he was as disoriented as an alien from a distant planet. He and his new neighbors shared nothing in common. Many seemed short on teeth but still spoke in uppity tones. The women appalled him. Where did they grow these heifers? Yet the gaggles of runny-nosed kids who trailed behind them were proof that men actually slept with them. Disgusting. So he kept to himself, kept control, held his demons at bay. </p><p> He did wrestle the devil on occasion. He emerged from the exercise room at the community center one sunny afternoon, sweaty and exhausted, and she was there at the pool, hair wet, skin glistening, a thirsty towel draped around her neck. She giggled with a friend, hunched her slim shoulders, and hugged her arms against a chilly breeze. Teeth chattering, she turned away. </p><p> He licked his lips and swallowed, close enough to see the gooseflesh rise on the inside of her pale thighs and how the clingy fabric of her wet bikini bottom rode up her crotch. </p><p> He positioned his exercise bag in front of him to conceal his excitement, catching his breath at the sight of her daintily extended bare leg as she slid gracefully into the car for the ride home. </p><p> The moment was defining. She saw him watching, he thought, and flaunted herself. Deliberately. Tried to turn him on and succeeded. Females are born knowing how to drive a man crazy. </p><p> Still, he never would have touched her but destiny intervened. Late one afternoon, as he nodded off in his underwear and socks watching a Yankees game taped over the weekend, the doorbell launched him to his feet, totally awake. </p><p> Instinctively, he dove for the small silver-colored automatic pistol concealed beneath a sofa cushion. He pressed his thick back to the wall and released the safety. </p><p> There was a growing chill outside the window and the feel of rain in the air. The streetlights were still dark. Cautiously, from behind the curtains, he squinted into the deepening dusk. </p><p> When he saw the figure alone in the lengthening shadows, persistently pushing his doorbell, he gasped. Quickly, he scanned the street. Perfect. No traffic in sight. No one watching. </p><p> "Hold on! I'll be right there!" He snatched his trousers off the back of a chair. </p><p> He zipped up, fingers fumbling as he fastened his belt, afraid she might leave. </p><p> He checked the window again before unlocking the door. Nothing had changed. She still stood there alone. He could scarcely believe his good fortune. What she wore electrified him: a badge, and her crisp, neatly starched uniform. <i>His wildest fantasy come true!</i> </p><p> He threw the door open and laughed aloud when he saw what had brought her, delivered her, to his door. </p><p> She was selling Girl Scout cookies.

I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me ... Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day - mock me horribly!&#39; A story of evil, debauchery and scandal, Oscar Wilde&#39;s only novel tells of Dorian Gray, a beautiful yet corrupt man. When he wishes that a perfect portrait of himself would bear the signs of ageing in his place, the picture becomes his hideous secret, as it follows Dorian&#39;s own downward spiral into cruelty and depravity. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of the evil in men&#39;s hearts, and is as controversial and alluring as Wilde himself. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>A Woman Named Jackie: An Intimate Biography of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis</h2><p>Presents a woman both creative and intelligent, and driven by ambition and an enjoyment of power, and culls the insights of friends, family, and acquaintances to portray a veteran of tremendous success and great tragedy</p><p><b>C.

Why do we fear the supernatural? What proof is there? Growing up in a haunted house, Roger Clarke spent much of his childhood trying to see a ghost. From the terrifying true events behind Henry James&#39;s The Turn of the Screw to the frenzy of the Cock Lane poltergeist, he takes us on a journey of belief with ghosts of every kind.</p><p>Raised in a haunted house, Roger Clarke is best known as a film-writer for the Independent newspaper and more recently Sight &amp; Sound. He was the youngest person ever to join the Society for Psychical Research in the 1980s and was getting his ghost stories published by the The Pan &amp; Fontana series of horror books aged only 15, when Roald Dahl asked his agent to take him on as a client. A published poet, his libretto for The Man with the Footsoles of Wind was performed at the Almeida Theatre in London in 1993. This is the book he always wanted to write.Beautifully written ... lithe, complicated and hugely rewarding -- James McConnachie * Sunday Times * Simmering as it is with personal reflections, this handsome volume ... is bursting with a giddy passion, buoyed further by an expert&#39;s thirst for abstruse facts.

[Clarke] has proven himself an ideal guide to this troubled and disorderly realm * Literary Review * Roger Clarke tells . . . gloriously weird stories with real verve, and also a kind of narrative authority that tends to constrain the sceptical voice within. There&#39;s simply so many of these accounts, each unique to its own setting but having much in common with the rest, particularly poltergeist activity and ghostly apparitions.

Research into the paranormal necessarily involves a fair degree of debunking, and Clarke is careful to be sceptical.

To solve those problems will require global cooperation. Nations must understand the need to go beyond parochial differences to avoid the destruction of our species. Malcolm Hillgartner is solid as narrator. He treats the material seriously, in the manner of a documentary narrator, but without the basso profundo voice that could quickly devolve into caricature. He varies his tone enough to keep the book interesting but not so much that it becomes distracting.

What motivated you to write a novel?</p> <p><strong>Del Toro:</strong> Well, it&#x2019;s a different challenge, but I've always written short stories and then, in my film work, storylines for movies (the storyline is a slightly "freer" form than screenplay writing) I have published some of my short stories in the past and it is my secret dream to write shivery tales for young readers. My favorite author in that sense is Roald Dahl who mixed it free-style between the grotesque and the magical. I love the short story form as a reader but if a novel has a terse structure I find it far more immersive and fulfilling. Nevertheless some of my favorite authors, Borges, Quiroga, Saki, etc. are masters of the short story form. The novel grew out of appetite and scope.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are one of the most extraordinarily imaginative and creative thinkers working in the arts today. What were some of the influences that have contributed to your success? Do you have any kind of a muse?</p> <p><strong> Del Toro: </strong>Curiously enough I regularly draw more inspiration from painters and books than I do from other films. Painters like Carlos Schwabe, Odilon Redon, Fliecien Rops, Bocklin, Freud, Bacon, Thomas Cole and many others, never fail to excite me and in the book front there are just as many authors... Dickens, does the trick every time as does Wilde, Rulfo, Quiroga, etc.</p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>Many of your movies have centered on fantastical characters. Why did you choose to write your first novel about vampires?</p> <p><strong><strong>Del Toro:</strong> </strong>All of my life I&#x2019;ve been fascinated by them but always from a Naturalist's point of view. <em>Cronos</em>, my first movie, wanted to be a rephrasing of the genre&#x2014;I love the rephrasing of an old myth. When I tackled <em>Blade II</em>, I approached it with a myriad of ideas about Vampire Biology but only a few of those made it into the film. Tonally, the movie needed to be an action film and some of the biological stuff was too disturbing already... I love the idea of the biological, the divine and the evolutionary angles to explain the origin and function of the Vampire genus. Some of my favorite books about Vampirism are treatises on Vampiric "fact&#x201d;--books by Bernard J Hurwood, Augustin Camet, and Montague Summers.</p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>There are many stories, movies, and even a television show involving vampires. The Strain Trilogy uses the idea that vampires are a plague, and that the lead hunter is a scientist from the Centers for Disease Control. What was your inspiration for this twist?</p> <p><strong><strong> Del Toro:</strong> </strong>When I was a kid I loved <em>The Night Stalker</em> and I fell in love with the idea Matheson and Rice posited, of exploring a creature of such powerful stature through the point of view of a common worker, a man used to deal with things in a procedural way. "Just another day at the job...".</p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>How did you and Chuck Hogan come together to write The Strain Trilogy? How does your collaboration work?</p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong><strong>Del Toro:</strong> </strong>It was a true collaboration. I had created a "bible" for the book. It contained most of the structural ideas and characters and Chuck then took his pass on it and invented new characters and ideas. Fet (one of my favorite characters) was completely invented by him. And then I did my pass, writing new chapters or heavily editing his pass, and then he did a pass on my pass and so on and so forth. This is the way I have co-written in the past. I loved Chuck's style and ideas from reading his books and I specifically wanted him as a partner because he had a strong sense of reality and had NEVER written a horror book. I knew we would complete each other in the creation of this book. What surprised me is that he came up with some gruesome moments all on his own! He revealed himself to be a rather disturbed man!</p> <p><strong><strong> A Q&amp;A with Hammett Award-winner Chuck Hogan</strong></strong></p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong><strong>Q:</strong> </strong>What most surprised you about working with Guillermo Del Toro? Has working with him impacted your own work? In your former career as a video store clerk, did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine working on a project like this&#x2014;with a legend like Del Toro?</p> <p><strong><strong>Hogan:</strong> </strong>I'd never co-authored anything, nor had I published a true work of horror before, and here I was embarking on an epic trilogy with a master of the genre. I probably should have been more intimidated--yet I felt an immediate kinship with the material, as well as true excitement at the challenge of bringing the story to life, both of which carried me through. Guillermo is a daunting first audience, and yet an incredibly generous collaborator. Not to mention an amazing resource: it's just fun to have to ask him a question&#x2014;say, about why the vampires run hot instead of cold&#x2014;know that, not only will he take me through their intricate biology, but he will embroider the account with corroborating examples from the field of entomology, marine life, and some arcane fact about the function of human blood platelets.</p> <p><strong><strong>Q:<em> </em></strong></strong><em>The Town</em>, <em> Devils in Exile</em>, and <em>The Killing Moon</em>, probe the dark side of human nature. What draws you to this theme, and to the genre of suspense?</p> <p><strong><strong><strong>Hogan:</strong> </strong></strong>Crime and horror are both genres of existentialism, and I am drawn to stories of man at his extremes, of people who find themselves tested, haunted, threatened. I believe a writer should challenge himself in his work just as he challenges the characters in his story&#x2014;that anything less would be inauthentic and dishonest. What I love about <em>The Strain</em> is that the journey of the story takes this maxim and multiplies it by one thousand.</p><p>Last week they invaded Manhattan.

At its root, it is not grinning skulls and sputtering candles in dark rooms. It is not that provincial. The secret society reflects one invisible tradition that has existed on Earth for a hundred thousand years. It is the main Way that people have lived on this planet. Excerpt from Introduction There is another way, another tradition, more invisible, more powerful. This book is about these two avenues. It is amazing, at this late date, that so many people think power is merely a cake of clay that six billion of us are beating at with hammers. It is astonishing that so many people think power is a mound of lumps and dust that six billion of us are fighting over. Power has been taken by very well-run organizations. Major power. On the other side of the coin, there is a growing crowd that thinks we must invoke fire-eating lizards or Satan to explain how power has been stolen from us. This is a book about the organizations that have carted off something very vital in the middle of the night and how to get it back. More than that, it is about the exact methods used to unhook us from all that we are. Excerpt There are nine official choirs of angels. For each of these types, we have various artistic depictions. The nine choirs are divided into three groups, each of which has three sub-types. The main branches of angels are the Counsellors, the Governors, and the Messengers. Under the Counsellors are the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones. The Governors include Dominions, Powers, and Virtues. The Messengers contain the Principalities, Archangels and Angels. Each of these nine groups has its own named leader, style of dress, and symbols. The Greek and Latin Fathers of the Church, eight of them, figure very prominently in Christian art . . . I find 10 symbols for these men. As for the Church itself, symbols abound. The ark, the ship, the ark of the covenant, the rock, the candelabra, wheat and tares, the mustard seed, and so on. I have counted 20 symbols. Furthermore, through displayed art, there is an ingenious typing of stories within the Church, in which a key tale is not only pictorialized, but also symbolized by showing other versions of it. For example, the specific type of story known as The Epiphany might be referred to by art showing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon not a Christian adventure at all or by the non-Christian Abner coming to see David, King of the Hebrews, or by Joseph s Hebrew brothers bowing down to him in Egypt. The Church holds that the real story behind all of these is: the Magi coming to see the Infant Lord. In Church art, you would see all of these tales depicted and all but one, the Real One, would have a symbolic meaning. How many such official archetypes of Church stories exist? Well, there is The Annunciation, The Incarnation, The Nativity, The Presentation, The Holy Innocents, The Holy Family in Egypt, The Return From Egypt, St. John the Baptist, Our Lord s Baptism, The Temptation, The Sermon on the Mount, The Raising of Lazarus, The Transfiguration, The Triumphal Entry, Our Lord Weeps Over Jerusalem, Cleansing the Temple, The Last Supper, The Traitor Revealed, Our Lord in Gethsemane, The Betrayal, The Accusation before Pilate, The Crowning With Thorns, Our Saviour Mocked, The Scourging, Bearing the Cross, The Sacrifice on Calvary, The Seamless Coat (taken from Jesus by soldiers at the cross), The Pierced Side, The Virgin Mother s Sorrow, the Descent from the Cross, The Entombment, the Descent Into Hell, The Resurrection, The Woman at the Tomb, The Appearance to Mary, The Appearance to the Disciples, Thomas, The Ascension, Pentecost, The Second Coming, the Unbelievers, The Believers, The Church, Holy Baptism, The Holy Eucharist.</p><p>In a stunning 30-year investigation, Jon Rappoport uncovers the basic formula of all groups which seek to control individuals and civilizations. And then he reveals an invisible tradition which has exhisted on this planet for 10,000 years. A tradition which can free us now from our personal limitatons.

More than that, it is about the exact methods used to unhook us from all that we are. </p><p>I have done enough excavation to expose the central ruse, to show two invisible traditions of history. I have gotten into the shiny stainless steel vault in the big bank, looked around, and pointed out the obvious. And then after that I have refused to budge. </p><p>I believe we are grappling, as if in a dream, with the layers of anesthetic that surround the core of our being. This book is a search for ... what? A platform from which to view the place in ourselves which could revolutionize the future. </p><p>This search is not new, and we have all been over significant ground before. But we turn away, we demean ourselves, we fabricate existence and lessen its meaning. We pay allegiance to myths and gods, we accept a shrunken view of history. But in history are veins of master substance, as it were, that can lead us back to ourselves in a new way. </p><p>The style of this book is not to set out, like file cabinets, a precise robot-march of facts which ultimately spell out a hypothesis. I rather take you along on my own adventure of discovery, because I want you to see and feel something, not merely make notes in the machine-part of the mind. </p><p>These days, the terms cult, secret society, and religion are all so loaded that their meanings are melting down. I use cult and secret society to mean: organized groups which harbor a hidden agenda whose purpose is to dominate and control others. This agenda doesn't rule out the existence of a merry public face. In fact, a cult may be doing good in one sphere while destroying life and limb on another front. </p><p>In this book, religion means a group which has a hierarchical power structure leading up to an invisible God. Naturally the God favors the religion which worships Him. Otherwise, why bother? Most religions are secret societies. They have an agenda which involves controlling their devotees, all their charity-work notwithstanding. </p><p>Historically, people seek out secret societies and religions and join them to gain freedom from pain and turmoil. People also join because they are forced to. For example, the country they live in leaves no choice. Such was the case in medieval Europe, where the Roman Catholic Church held the wand of dominance. But there is another factor. The popular term for it these days is mind control. It used to be brainwashing, hypnotism. I will discuss that aspect at length, in an unusual way. </p><p>When I use only the first name of a person, that name is fictitious. The reason is the same in all such cases: to ensure privacy. This book can offer much evidence to support its conclusions, but it cannot rest on absolute proof. Because of the nature of the subject, I have had to rely, in certain crucial situations, on the testimony of anonymous sources. I have also, as I say, chosen to rely on my personal experience, because the story that will now unfold is empty without it.</p></p><h2>Selected Stories of Eudora Welty: A Curtain of Green and Other Stories (Modern Library)</h2><p>Eudora Welty's subjects are the people who live in southern towns like Jackson, Mississippi, which has been her home for all of her long life. I've stayed in one place,' she says, and 'it's become the source of the information that stirs my imagination.' Her distinctive voice and wry observations are rooted in the southern conversational tradition. The stories in this volume, from the first two collections she published, range in tone from the quietly understated and psychologically subtle to the outrageously grotesque. Linking them all is Welty's remarkable ear for the language and point of view of the South. 'She's a lot smarter than her cousins in Beula,' someone remarks about a reputed suicide in one story. 'Especially Edna Earle, that never did get to be what you'd call a heavy thinker. Edna Earle could sit and ponder all day on how the little tail of the 'c' got through the 'I' in a Coca-Cola sign." <br><br>The stories in this volume, from the first two collections she published, range in tone from the quietly understated and psychologically subtle to the outrageously grotesque.</p><p>One of America's most admired authors, Eudora Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi, which is still her home.

Not just the visible ones, like the towers of the sunset, but those unseen, like the heart of a man or the soul of a wizard.<br>Not that you will believe. Patterns work that way, for each individual is captured by her patterns, even as she must reconcile them.<br>The lady named Megaera, if indeed merely that, sees all the patterns, yet for all she sees and says, for all the truth in the Legend, logic and the towers fail. Logic indeed is a frail structure to hold a reality that must encompass both order and chaos, especially when Black supports order and White is the sign of chaos.<br>Even logic must fall to understanding, to those who can laugh at their chains and shatter chaos and upend order, even more so than the so-called gods and those who call upon them. Or the Furies that followed the fallen angels of Heaven.<br>Has there been a god in Candar? Did the angels in truth fall upon the Roof of the World? How true is the Legend? The patterns supply no answers, but any story must start somewhere, even if its beginning seems like the ending of another tale, or the middle of a third epic.

Who built them? The angels of Heaven? The musician knows no answers except those of his music, and of his heart, which lies colder than the strings of the guitar he bears with him.<br>Suffice it to say that the castle is called Westwind...founded by a long-dead captain: Ryba, from the swift ships of Heaven.<br>Her many-time daughter&#x2019;s son--but that is the story to come<br>.<br>Copyright � 1992 by L.

She lives a rich life in Pasadena, California.In the end, it is practical advice (words of tactical wisdom, that is) that gets us moving, motivated, and changing. Psychologist Frankel, author of <i>Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office</i> (2004), recognizes that fact by focusing on 75 "female" money mistakes--and how to correct them. For sure, there are a handful of different actions--getting in the money game, taking charge, spending wisely, learning money basics, saving and investing for the future, managing financial work potential, and playing it smart--that are then segmented into errors, no matter what the root causes. "Taking charge," for instance, admonishes those who don't trust their intuition and who let a deadbeat dad skirt his responsibilities, among others. Each reprimand, though, is accompanied by at least two coaching "how to overcome" tips and enlivened with client stories and personal anecdotes. Here, at last, is the commonsense retort to that old wives' tale that it's just as easy to marry a rich man as a poor one. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She offers incisive, detailed profiles of such prominent leaders as Newark Mayor Cory Booker, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, and U.S. Congressman Artur Davis of Alabama (all interviewed for this book), and also covers numerous up-and-coming figures from across the nation. Drawing on exclusive interviews with power brokers such as President Obama, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Vernon Jordan, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, his son Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and many others, as well as her own razor-sharp observations and analysis of such issues as generational conflict, the race/ gender clash, and the "black enough" conundrum, Ifill shows why this is a pivotal moment in American history. <br><br><i>The Breakthrough </i>is a remarkable look at contemporary politics and an essential foundation for understanding the future of American democracy in the age of Obama.</p></p><p><p>GWEN IFILL is moderator and managing editor of <i>Washington Week </i>and senior correspondent of <i>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. </i>Before coming to PBS, she was chief congressional and political correspondent for NBC News, and had been a reporter for the<i> New York Times</i>, the<i> Washington Post</i>, the<i> Baltimore Sun</i>, and <i>Boston Herald American. </i>She lives in Washington, D.C.</p>INTRODUCTION<br><br>I learned how to cover race riots by telephone. They didn't pay me enough at my first newspaper job to venture onto the grounds of South Boston High School when bricks were being thrown. Instead, I would telephone the headmaster and ask him to relay to me the number of broken chairs in the cafeteria each day. A white colleague dispatched to the scene would fill in the details for me.<br><br>I've spent 30 years in journalism since then chronicling stories like that &#x2013; places where truth and consequences collide, rub up against each other, and shift history's course. None of that prepared me for 2008 and the astonishing rise of Barack Obama.<br><br>It is true that he accomplished what no black man had before, but it went farther than that. Simply as an exercise in efficient politics, Obama '08 rewrote the textbook. His accomplishment was historic and one that transformed how race and politics intersect in our society. Obama is the leading edge of this change, but his success is merely the ripple in a pond that grows deeper every day.<br><br>"When people do something that they've never done before, I think that makes it easier to do it a second time," David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's chief strategist, told me just days after Obama won. "So when people vote for an African American candidate, I think itmakes it easier for the next African American candidate."<br><br>The next African American candidates &#x2013; and a fair share of those already in office, subscribe to a formula driven as much by demographics as destiny. When population shifts &#x2013; brought about by fair housing laws, affirmative action and landmark school desegregation rulings &#x2013; political power is challenged as well. It happened in Boston, New York, Chicago and every other big city reshaped by an influx of European immigration. It is happening again now in Miami and Los Angeles, in suburban Virginia and in rural North Carolina, where the political calculus is being reshaped by Latino immigrants. With African Americans, freighted with the legacy of slavery and the pushback from whites who refuse to feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors, the shift has been more scattered and sporadic &#x2013; yet no less profound.<br><br>Boston was awash in the sort racial drama that foreshadows dramatic change when I began my journalism career at the Boston Herald American in 1977.<br><br>While I was attending Simmons College, the Federal courts demanded that the city's very political school committee fix the city's racially unbalanced education system.<br><br>The solution, imposed by U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity in 1974, seemed pretty straightforward. Send white children to black neighborhoods and black children to white neighborhoods. It came to be known as forced busing.<br><br>The idea was to impose balance where it no longer existed. The optimistic reasoning was that the resources -- teachers, textbooks, shared experience -- would follow. But history now shows us busing &#x2013; moving 20,000 students to and fro in search of quality education was, in fact, a far more radical notion than originally envisioned. It struck at the heart of neighborhood and racial identity in cities all over the nation, most memorably so in Irish South Boston and black Roxbury.<br><br>White residents of insular neighborhoods railed &#x2013; sometimes violently &#x2013; against the incursion into their neighborhood schools. Black residents in Roxbury railed right back.<br><br>As I walked to my college classes in Boston's Fenway neighborhood that fall, I saw the result with my own eyes -- Boston's finest in riot gear stepping in to prevent clashes at English High School. It was a scene that played out again and again all over the city, all over the country.<br><br>"The white kids don't like black kids and black kids don't like white kids," one white student said after one of the melees I covered by phone. "All of it is prejudice. All I know is that no one's getting any education."<br><br>"It's a perfect example that forced desegregation and forced busing does not work," Elvira Pixie Palladino, an anti-busing member of the school committee told me at the time.<br><br>White students fled the city schools during those years, so many that the majority-white city's education system became majority black within a decade. By 2000, only a quarter of the city's children were white. Drastically fewer &#x2013; under 14 percent &#x2013; were enrolled in the city's elementary schools.<br><br>It took some years, and a more sophisticated understanding of how race and poverty intersect, for me to begin to understand that what I saw in Boston was about more than just black and white kids not liking each other. It was the beginning of a power shift that was defined by, but not limited to, race.<br><br>I moved to Baltimore in 1981, where the tipping point I had witnessed taking shape in Boston was a little farther along. When I arrived, the city's leaders were still mostly white, but 56 percent of the city's residents were already nonwhite, a number that grew to 64 percent by 2000.<br><br>On the surface, Baltimore's political vibe was less charged than Boston's, but the power shifts were no less significant. The city's paternalistic mayor, William Donald Schaefer, had revived downtown with a national aquarium and a Disney-like harbor development that brought tourists in droves. Twin baseball and football stadiums were poised to sprout on downtown's southern edge. Gleaming condominiums and hotels replaced what had been rundown waterfront docks. Schaefer was hailed in national magazines as an urban savior. Howard Cosell told a Monday Night Football audience that Schaefer was "the genius mayor."<br><br>But not far from the glittering downtown development most convention visitors saw, the picture was more complicated. Crime was climbing. The schools were sliding. And change was in the offing.<br><br>Schaefer, an unmarried curmudgeon used to getting his own way, was suspicious of change. And he was doubly suspicious of any call for change that seemed rooted in racial claim. That meant that he would also be suspicious of me, a black woman whose job it was to ask him questions he did not like. As he growled and snapped at me &#x2013; and, honestly, at most other reporters too &#x2013; I came to realize what I was witnessing: the friction that is a necessary byproduct of sandpaper change.<br><br>In 1983, Billy Murphy, a black judge and scion of a prominent local family decided to use the sandpaper. Schaefer was still immensely popular, but he was also aware that new minority majorities had recently swept black mayors into office for the first time in cities like Atlanta, and that the barrier was about to fall that year in Philadelphia as well.<br><br>In the end, Murphy turned out to be a pretty inadequate Democratic primary candidate, disorganized and unfocused. Even though then-Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, Martin Luther King 3rd and comedian and activist Dick Gregory came to town to campaign for him, Schaefer still managed to snare fully half of the black vote, in a majority black city.<br><br>Even in defeat though, Murphy's challenge was enough to open some eyes to the possibility that the "mayor for life," as Schaefer had been dubbed, might be displaced. Perhaps it was time for a candidate who looked like most of the people who lived in the city. Schaefer hated this line of reasoning, openly detested Murphy and refused to speak his name aloud. Still, he saw the handwriting on the wall.<br><br>Four years later, Baltimore did get its black mayor when, after 16 years in charge, Schaefer was elected governor and selected a successor to fill his unexpired term. Clarence "Du" Burns, the affable City Council president who rose to that position from humble beginnings as a locker room attendant, was only too happy to claim a job he may never have been able to win outright. "I got standing ovations at churches," Burns marveled years later. "I hadn't done anything for them, but I was the first black mayor, y'understand?"<br><br>Burns, who learned the ways of city politics behind every closed door at City Hall, ended up spending 17 years there, but only 11 months as mayor. The first time he ran for the job outright, Burns was defeated by a younger, politically unannointed Yale and Harvard-educated attorney, a black man with the unlikely name of Kurt Schmoke. Schmoke, had abandoned a prestigious post in the Carter White House to return home to Baltimore. "I thought why did he give up working in the White House?" said his former White House colleague Christopher Edley Jr. "What's going on? And he said, I'm going to indict a few bad guys, make some connections in the corporate world and run for office."<br><br>That is exactly what Schmoke did, first winning election as state's attorney before making the run for City Hall. Even though he was up against the well-oiled Schaefer machine, Schmoke defeated Burns by 5,000 votes by capturing the imagination of Baltimore voters &#x2013; black and white &#x2013; in a way neither Murphy nor Burns, with their old-school ties and backroom ways, could not.<br><br>"I was kind of the beneficiary in a way of a change sparked by the latter end of civil rights movement," said Schmoke, who is now the dean of the Howard University School of Law, which produced Thurgood Marshall, L. Douglas Wilder and Vernon Jordan. "The voting rights act, which opened up so many opportunities throughout the country, started to hit its stride by 1980, and people built on that."<br><br>That trend was also in evidence about 40 minutes down the interstate highway in Prince George's County, Maryland. By 1984, I had taken my unintentional road trip through sandpaper politics to this Washington suburb, where --- between 1980 and 1990 &#x2013; the African American population spurted from 37 to 50 percent. During that same period, nearly 77,000 whites moved elsewhere &#x2013; a loss of nearly 20 percent of the county's white population.<br><br>The county's power structure was in the midst of a corresponding shift from mostly white to mostly black when I was covering it for the Washington Post.

His photographs were first shown in Paris in 1952, the catalogue for which exhibition included an introduction by Man Ray, and he began working for French <i>Vogue</i> in 1954.<br><br>Inspired by Man Ray's brand of Surrealism, Bourdin rejected the descriptive roles of photography in favour of an exploration of the medium's capacity for the divergent. Along with certain American photographers, notably Edward Weston, Bourdin recognized a concern with formal perfection and extremely high finish that became his own objective, one perfectly adapted to the deceptive sophistication of fashion imagery, the landscape in which he developed his ideas for over thirty years.<br><br>At French <i>Vogue</i>, Bourdin demanded and was allowed unique editorial control and amazingly he extended this to his principal client in advertising, the shoe company Charles Jourdan, who first commissioned him in the 1960s. Bourdin's approach to campaigns reflected a distinct change for advertising in this period. Bourdin rejected the 'product shot' in favour of atmospheric, often surreal tableaux and suggestions of narrative. Bourdin was not alone in demystifying the object, but he was the most radical in his approach.<br><br>The impact of the imagery of Guy Bourdin on both commercial and fine art photography continues to resonate today, Bourdin made radical changes both in the style and the meaning of commercial imagery. His fashion shoots are mysterious, hypnotic, surreal, exposing the true and unnerving nature of desire. He shows that, within the context of fashion, it is rarely the product that compels us. It is the image ? carefully staged narrative of sexual fantasy, the quest for the unattainable, the suggestion of danger ? that stimulates consumer desire.</p><p>Alison Gingeras is an international curator and writer based in Paris.

The cooking from this part of the world is particularly rich and complex, and features increasingly on the menus of British, French and American masterchefs. In exploring each of the regions, this book contrasts, compares and celebrates the extreme regionality of Italian cooking: in Piedmont the beef is braised in Barolo wine; in Venzia-Giulia it becomes goulash, while Genova adds a touch of the sea - anchovy fillets - to its braised beef. The tour covers Lombardy, Val d&#39;Aosta, Piedmont, Le Tre Venezie, Liguria, Tuscany and Umbria, Le Marche and Emilia Romagna - this last region recognized generally as the culinary epicentre of Italy.</p><p><b>Anna Del Cont�</b> is widely recognized as the doyenne of Italian cooking.

She was awarded the Guild of Food Writers Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.</p><h2>Cold War: An Illustrated History, 1945-1991</h2><p>A companion volume to the twenty-four-part documentary on the history of the Cold War ranges from the fall of Germany at the end of the Second World War to the fall of the Berlin Wall and dissolution of the Soviet Union. TV tie-in.</p><p>Beautifully designed and illustrated with hundreds of photographs, this companion volume to the CNN documentary series begins with the roots of the cold war: the military intervention by six nations (including the United States) in the Bolshevik's 1917 Russian Revolution. The book then takes on the cold war proper, from the post-WWII rise of the Iron Curtain to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet government in the early '90s. "For forty-five years," the authors write, "the peoples of the world held their breath," through missile crises, policies of "mutual assured destruction," the Vietnam War, and the uneasy steps toward d�tente and full peace highlighted by Richard Nixon's meetings with Brezhnev and by Mikhail Gorbachev's meetings with Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Special sections highlight the role of spies in the cold war, as well as the films and literature of the era. This is a copiously detailed account of <i>the</i> major historical force of the latter half of the 20th century that would make an excellent reference book for any household.Libraries that see heavy demand for tie-in volumes when PBS and BBC historical documentaries hit the air should expect interest in this lavishly illustrated history of the cold war, which accompanies a 24-episode series that CNN will broadcast this fall. The British producers are credited as the book's authors; they acknowledge the aid of "an international panel of distinguished historians." The text incorporates some recent scholarship based on newly available Soviet and U.S. documents; it opens with a description of the U.S.S.R.'s history from 1917 to 1945, then traces the sources and consequences of East-West confrontation from the late 1940s through the fall of the Berlin Wall. The hundreds of photos and other illustrations will bring back vivid memories for those who lived through those decades, but the volume may be most valuable for readers too young to remember armed struggles in Berlin, Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam or catchphrases like<i> Iron Curtain</i>, <i>de tente</i>, and <i>mutually assured destruction</i>. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>Operation Unleashed (Cutter&#39;s Code, 4)</h2><p>Stepping up to the plate will put him in the line of fire...&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>For Drew Kiley, married life isn't what he had in mind. Driven to "I do" by a sense of familial responsibility, he assumes the role of husband to his brother's wife, Alyssa...and the role of father to his nephew, Luke. It seems to be the logical solution in light of his brother's abandonment. But Drew doesn't know the whole truth about his brother's past. A rescue from a canine companion sets Drew and Alyssa on a perilous course of extortion, kidnapping and secrets unveiled. United in their determination to protect Luke, Drew and Alyssa learn to depend on each other. But as tensions escalate, so does a deep undercurrent of desire that casts their marriage in a different light.</p><p>Justine Davis lives on Puget Sound in Washington State, watching big ships and the occasional submarine go by, and sharing the neighborhood with assorted wildlife, including a pair of bald eagles, deer, a bear or two, and a tailless raccoon. In the few hours when she's not planning, plotting, or writing her next book, her favorite things are photography, knitting her way through a huge yarn stash, and driving her restored 1967 Corvette roadster&#x2014;top down, of course.Quinn Foxworth had never really realized just how loud a dog's bark could be. For an instant, when Cutter exploded into earsplitting noise inside the closed vehicle, a vision of distant sands and guard dogs trumpeting a warning of an enemy inside the perimeter shot through his mind.<br><br>That hadn't happened for a long time. He consciously eased his muscles, especially his hands, on the steering wheel and instinctively slowed the SUV down.<br><br>"Loud when he wants to be, isn't he?"<br><br>Quinn looked over at his fianc�e, and the last of the memory vanished. He was grateful she hadn't noticed his reaction. And then her gaze locked on his and he saw in her eyes that Hayley hadn't missed a thing. But she had intentionally not prodded.<br><br>No wonder he loved her beyond measure.<br><br>"Yes," he said belatedly, having to raise his voice just as she had to be heard over the cacophony from the back of the SUV.<br><br>"He's not usually like that in the car," she said. "You know he has exquisite manners. Well, except for when that guy tried to reach in."<br><br>"Good for him. And lucky for the guy it wasn't me."<br><br>She smiled. Yeah, he loved her all right. And their wedding wasn't soon enough to suit him, even though it was less than a month away.<br><br>The barking suddenly morphed into a howl, and Cutter clawed at the back hatch of the car.<br><br>"Well, that's a new one," Hayley said, wincing at the sound.<br><br>"Easy, dog," Quinn said, but the howling continued.<br><br>He'd learned by now that ignoring Cutter was never a good idea. They were on a rather narrow lane, headed home from the indulgence of a breakfast out, but they'd passed a park a few yards back. He checked the mirrors, then put the SUV in Reverse. The moment they began to back up, the howling subsided to a mild whine that at least allowed room for thought.<br><br>He backed up until he could swing into the small parking area. The whine stopped. But Cutter was clearly still on full alert, ears and tail up, staring out toward the park.<br><br>"I suppose he wants out."<br><br>"It's raining," Hayley said, "of course he does."<br><br>With a sigh, Quinn hit the button that raised the hatch. Before he could even get his door open Cutter was out and running across the wet grass of the park.<br><br>"Well, he's thoroughly unleashed now," Quinn muttered as he walked around the back of the car to where Hayley stood, watching the dog go.<br><br>"Did that look full of intent to you?" she asked.<br><br>Hayley was focused on Cutter. Quinn stole the moment to just look at her again. He never got tired of the little jab of wonder that struck him when he realized she was his, that she would always be by his side.<br><br>"Quinn?"<br><br>"Sorry," he said, not meaning it in the least. "I was distracted by the view. As usual."<br><br>He loved that she still colored up when he said stuff like that.<br><br>"Thank you," she said simply. "But..."<br><br>She gestured toward the far side of the park, where their rascal of a dog was approaching the child who sat on one of the swings. A blond boy in jeans and a sweatshirt but no jacket, with a small backpack beside him. He was staring at the ground, digging a sneakered toe into the mud.<br><br>"If you mean did all that ruckus in the car and then the beeline over there seem very specific, then yes," he said in answer to her original question. "We'd better go rein him in. Don't want the kid getting scared."<br><br>She nodded, and they started across the grass. The rain was coming down steadily, but lightly. Cutter was almost there, but the boy hadn't seemed to notice. In fact, he didn't seem to be noticing anything except the way the mud oozed around what looked to be fairly new, once white sneakers.<br><br>Cutter had come to a halt about two feet away from the boy. "Maybe he just wants to play," Hayley said. "There haven't been any kids around for him to play with lately, since Brian moved away."<br><br>The dog sat. Waited.<br><br>"Well, he's not playing," Quinn said. "And the kid doesn't look much like he wants to."<br><br>"It is raining."<br><br>"When I was that age, I couldn't have cared less if it was raining if there was playing to be done."<br><br>Hayley laughed, a light, lovely sound that never failed to expand the warmth he always felt when he was with her.<br><br>"Not every boy is a bold adventurer such as yourself," she teased.<br><br>"That's what I get for being born before kids became tethered to a video game console."<br><br>"Thank goodness."<br><br>She turned her gaze back to the pair they were nearing. Cutter had reached out with his nose, and the boy had responded perfectly, holding out his hand, low and slow, for the dog to sniff. Someone had taught him, Quinn thought.<br><br>And then the dog rose and went forward, turning sideways to lean against the boy's knees. The boy moved then, reaching to pat the dog. Cutter leaned harder. The boy's fingers burrowed into thick fur. And Cutter leaned even more. They were just close enough to hear the odd sound the boy made before he leaned forward himself, wrapping his arms around the animal's neck as if he were a life preserver. Cutter twisted his head up and back, and swiped his tongue across the boy's cheek. A smile broke through, and only when he saw it did Quinn realize just how downcast the boy had seemed.<br><br>"You're right, Cutter isn't acting like he wants to play, either," Hayley finally agreed. "In fact, he looks like."<br><br>Her voice faded away. Quinn nodded. Spoke quietly.<br><br>"Yeah. He looks like he's protecting."<br><br>"Standing between that boy and the world," she said softly.<br><br>Quinn let out a compressed breath. "I knew it had been too quiet these last couple of weeks."<br><br>When the boy looked up at them, his expression wary, they stopped a few feet away. Cutter looked at them, his tail wagging in greeting. He made a quiet little whuffing sound, but never moved away from the boy.<br><br>Quinn held back slightly, letting Hayley take the lead with the child.<br><br>"Hi," she said softly. "That's Cutter, if you were wondering what his name is."<br><br>The boy clung to the dog. "Cutter?"<br><br>That earned him another swipe of the tongue that made him smile despite his wariness.<br><br>"What kind of dog is he? I like how he's black in front and brown in back."<br><br>"We're not sure, exactly. He looks like a sheepdog that comes from Europe."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"Are you here by yourself?" Hayley asked.<br><br>The boy's expression went back to wary. His gaze flicked to Quinn, then back to Hayley. "I'm not supposed to talk to strangers."<br><br>"That's a good plan." Quinn spoke for the first time, gently. "But Cutter's already introduced himself."<br><br>"My mom says sometimes bad people use dogs or cats to try and trick kids."<br><br>Hayley smiled. "Good for your mom. She's right, and I'm glad she warned you about that. So why don't you take us to her? Then we can talk to her and not be strangers anymore. And she can decide if it's okay for you to get to know Cutter."<br><br>The boy sighed. "She'll say no. She's mad again."<br><br>"At you?" Quinn asked.<br><br>"Sort of. And at my dad."<br><br>Hayley glanced at Quinn. He nodded; the boy seemed to talk more easily to her, understandably. "What did your dad do?"<br><br>"He said something bad about my father."<br><br>Uh-oh, Quinn thought. Already into a domestic situation. Divorce, stepfather, that could get ugly. Except the boy had called him his dad. Did you do that with a stepfather you didn't like? Then again, the kid was very young. Maybe he was just calling him what he was told to call him.<br><br>"Your dad and your father don't get along?" Hayley asked, using the boy's terms.<br><br>"He's really my uncle. My father's dead."<br><br>Hayley blinked again.<br><br>"Who's your uncle?" Quinn asked, starting to feel as if he'd stumbled into some kind of comedy skit. But the boy's expression wasn't the least bit amused.<br><br>"My dad."<br><br>Quinn wasn't much good at guessing ages on kids this young, but he put this one at somewhere in the six to eight range. Six in size, but older in the sadness in his eyes. A kid that young shouldn't be able to look like that. Younger even than the ten he had been when his parents had been killed. But at least this one still had his mother. And...whoever the father figure in his life really was.<br><br>"It's my fault," the boy said in a tiny voice.<br><br>Hayley moved then, closer. He knew this woman, knew she wouldn't be able to just leave a child who sounded so miserable. He wasn't sure he could walk away himself. Hayley teased him&#x2014;lovingly&#x2014;about being a protector to the core. Maybe she was right.<br><br>Hayley crouched in front of the boy on the swing. She didn't say any of the things most would, like "I'm sure it's not," or "You must have misunderstood." Instead, she simply asked, "Why is it your fault?"<br><br>The boy dug the toe of one sneaker deeper into the mud beneath the swing. "It just is. If I went away, then they'd be happy."<br><br>Hayley went very still. Quinn understood. No child should feel that way, but to hear it from one this young was unsettling.<br><br>"I'm sure they would miss you terribly," Hayley said softly.<br><br>The boy stayed silent then, as if he'd suddenly remembered he was still talking to strangers. Or as if he didn't believe a word of it.<br><br>And Quinn suddenly realized Cutter was staring at him. That intense, unsettling gaze was unwavering, and by now Quinn knew all too well what it meant.<br><br><i>Fix it.</i><br><br>He no longer bothered rationalizing it, not even to himself. He'd simply had to accept, by virtue of an undeniable amount of empirical evidence, that the dog knew what he was doing and somehow communicated it to anyone who would pay attention. And he seemed to instinctively know who would get the message, just as he always seemed to know who was in trouble and needed his help.<br><br>The problem was Quinn's, not Cutter's. How was he going to explain to a dog that absent genuine abuse, Fox-worth never interfered in marital or parent-child situations? But family matter or not, when a boy this young talked about going away, it deserved some intervention. Just not the full force of the Foxworth organization.<br><br>On that thought, the dog let out a small sound, a soft but emphatic woof. Then he turned his attention back to the boy. Quinn felt decidedly shrugged off. Cutter had directed "Fix it," and fix it he meant.<br><br>"You know," Hayley was saying to the still silent boy, "Cutter's pretty smart. He's not a Bloodhound, but I'll bet he could find your house without you even telling him where it is."<br><br>Damn, she was good, Quinn thought. She had the boy's attention now, and she'd managed to focus it on an idea most kids his age would find irresistible. She'd be a great mom.<br><br>For an instant his stomach went into free fall. They weren't even married yet and he was thinking about kids? When not so long ago he would have sworn that would never happen, that he would never, ever bring kids into a world so screwed up by the people supposedly running it? But a baby, with Hayley? Their child?<br><br><i>Right,</i> he muttered inwardly. <i>Just dealing with this kid's got you going sideways. You'd be great with one of your own.</i><br><br>"Could he?" the boy asked, stroking the dog's head.<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Shall we see?"<br><br>She glanced at Quinn. He gave her a half shrug. He'd been working with the dog on commands, if you could call it working when the animal seemed to learn everything on the first try. Once he'd come to trust the dog, once they had all accepted him as part of the team, he'd realized it would be best if everybody knew and used the same commands. He'd thought about using a different language, as military and police K-9s did to insure the dog obeyed only their orders, but since Cutter tended to completely ignore anyone he didn't know and trust telling him what to do, it seemed unnecessary.<br><br>"We can try," Quinn said. "Just remember Foxworth doesn't do domestic."<br><br>Hayley flashed him the smile that never failed to send a shiver down his spine. "It's not me, it's him you have to convince," she said, nodding toward Cutter. She didn't add, "And good luck with that," but it was in her tone anyway.<br><br>"Great," he muttered. He'd never met a more stubborn creature than that dog, and that included himself and even Rafe. "Let's go, then."<br><br>The boy looked at him somewhat warily. Quinn softened his voice. "Shall we see if he can do it?"<br><br>The boy still didn't speak, but slid off the swing.<br><br>"Cutter," Quinn said in an entirely different tone, one of command. The dog's head snapped around, those intense eyes fastened on him. Quinn pointed at the boy.<br><br>"Backtrack," he ordered.<br><br>The dog glanced from Quinn to the boy, then back. And then he whirled on his hindquarters and trotted off toward the tall trees. Quinn watched the boy watch the dog, saw the child's eyes widen when Cutter stopped at the edge of the forest, beside a tall hemlock with a long branch dragging downward, and looked back over his shoulder at them.<br><br>"That's my secret path! He does know!"<br><br>He took off after the dog at a run.<br><br>Quinn and Hayley followed. At least this, Quinn thought, should be quick. Return the kid home, and then they themselves could go home. And he could get back to his thoughts of luring Hayley back to bed for a leisurely afternoon of enjoying the miracle of them together.<br><br>He tried to ignore the little voice in his head reminding him that with Cutter, nothing was ever that simple.</p><h2>Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between)</h2><p><p>An unparalleled exploration of the mysteries underlying women&#x2019;s sexuality that rivals the culture-shifting Kinsey Report, from two of America&#x2019;s leading research psychologists </p><p>Do women have sex simply to reproduce or display their affection?

Drawing on more than a thousand intensive interviews conducted solely for the book, as well as their pioneering research on physiological response and evolutionary emotions, Why Women Have Sex uncovers an amazingly complex and nuanced portrait of female sexuality. They delve into the use of sex as a defensive tactic against a mate&#x2019;s infidelity (protection), as a ploy to boost self-confidence (status), as a barter for gifts or household chores (resource acquisition), or as a cure for a migraine headache (medication). </p><p><i>Why Women Have Sex</i> stands as the richest and deepest psychological understanding of female sexuality yet achieved and promises to inform every woman&#x2019;s (and her partner&#x2019;s) awareness of her relationship to sex and her sexuality. </p></p><p><p>Cindy M.

His descriptions of battles and campaigns, from Fort Sumter to the post-Appomattox surrender of Gen.

His brief portraits of the principal civilian and military leaders, both North and South, are colorful and lively: Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, for one, is described as "five feet full of bounce, brilliance, and belligerence." Perhaps the book's most noteworthy accomplishment is its clarifying examination of slavery in the South, showing how the national controversy over the system shifted from the economic to the moral plane and why the dispute became insoluble by peaceful means. Readers won't find a finer one-volume popular introduction to the War Between the States. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In a book surprisingly and wholly uninformed by the "new military history" and the significant recent work on the Civil War, Leckie recounts a schoolbook story of battles and leaders, with much attention devoted to Gettysburg (three chapters), less to Western engagements, and virtually nothing to the common soldier, the war at home, or the meaning of the great conflict. He has raked up many old chestnuts about Lincoln, Grant, and company, and cast them in a lively, anecdotal narrative. But to learn about the making and meaning of the war, readers should turn to James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom (LJ 3/1/88; one of LJ 's "Best Books of 1988") and Phillip Paludan's A People's Contest (HarperCollins, 1988), or, indeed, any of the classic accounts by Bruce Catton, Shelby Foote, Peter Parish, or Bell Wiley. --Randall M.

Sea Change </b><br><br>At five-forty-five in the morning, Paul and I rousted ourselves from our warm bunk and peered out of the small porthole in our cabin aboard the SS America. Neither of us had slept very well that night, partially due to the weather and partially due to our rising excitement. We rubbed our eyes and squinted through the glass, and could see it was foggy out. But through the deep-blue dawn and swirling murk we spied rows of twinkling lights along the shore. It was Wednesday, November 3, 1948, and we had finally arrived at Le Havre, France. <br><br>I had never been to Europe before and didn't know what to expect. We had been at sea for a week, although it seemed a lot longer, and I was more than ready to step onto terra firma. As soon as our family had seen us off in fall-colored New York, the America had sailed straight into the teeth of a North Atlantic gale. As the big ship heeled and bucked in waves as tall as buildings, there was a constant sound of bashing, clashing, clicking, shuddering, swaying, and groaning. Lifelines were strung along the corridors. Up...up...up...the enormous liner would rise, and at the peak she'd teeter for a moment, then down...down...down...she'd slide until her bow plunged into the trough with a great shuddering spray. Our muscles ached, our minds were weary, and smashed crockery was strewn about the floor. Most of the ship's passengers, and some of her crew, were green around the gills. Paul and I were lucky to be good sailors, with cast-iron stomachs: one morning we counted as two of the five passengers who made it to breakfast. <br><br>I had spent only a little time at sea, on my way to and from Asia during the Second World War, and had never experienced a storm like this before. Paul, on the other hand, had seen every kind of weather imaginable. In the early 1920s, unable to afford college, he had sailed from the United States to Panama on an oil tanker, hitched a ride on a little ferry from Marseille to Africa, crossed the Mediterranean and Atlantic from Trieste to New York, crewed aboard a schooner that sailed from Nova Scotia to South America, and served briefly aboard a command ship in the China Sea during World War II. He'd experienced waterspouts, lightning storms, and plenty of the "primordial violence of nature," as he put it. Paul was a sometimes macho, sometimes quiet, willful, bookish man. He suffered terrible vertigo, yet was the kind to push himself up to the top of a ship's rigging in a fierce gale. It was typical that aboard the tossing SS America he did most of the worrying for the two of us. <br><br>Paul had been offered the job of running the exhibits office for the United States Information Service (USIS), at the American embassy in Paris. His assignment was to help promote French-American relations through the visual arts. It was a sort of cultural/propaganda job, and he was well suited for it. Paul had lived and worked in France in the 1920s, spoke the language beautifully, and adored French food and wine. Paris was his favorite city in the world. So, when the U.S. government offered him a job there, he jumped at the chance. I just tagged along as his extra baggage. <br><br>Travel, we agreed, was a litmus test: if we could make the best of the chaos and serendipity that we'd inevitably meet in transit, then we'd surely be able to sail through the rest of life together just fine. So far, we'd done pretty well. <br><br>We had met in Ceylon in the summer of 1944, when we'd both been posted there by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA. Paul was an artist, and he'd been recruited to create war rooms where General Mountbatten could review the intelligence that our agents had sent in from the field. I was head of the Registry, where, among other things, I processed agents' reports from the field and other top-secret papers. Late in the war, Paul and I were transferred to Kunming, China, where we worked for General Wedemeyer and continued our courtship over delicious Chinese food. <br><br>Although we had met abroad, we didn't count our wartime in Asia as real living-time abroad: we were working seven days a week, sleeping in group quarters, and constantly at the beck and call of the military. <br><br>But now the war was over. We had been married in 1946, lived for two years in Washington, D.C., and were moving to Paris. We'd been so busy since our wedding day, September 1, 1946, that we'd never taken a proper honeymoon. Perhaps a few years in Paris would make up for that sorry state of affairs and give us a sort of working honeymoon. Well, it sounded like a good plan. <br><br>As I gazed through the porthole at the twinkling lights of Le Havre, I realized I had no idea what I was looking at. France was a misty abstraction for me, a land I had long imagined but had no real sense of. And while I couldn't wait to step ashore, I had my reasons to be suspicious of it. <br><br>In Pasadena, California, where I was raised, France did not have a good reputation. My tall and taciturn father, "Big John" McWilliams, liked to say that all Europeans, especially the French, were "dark" and "dirty," although he'd never actually been to Europe and didn't know any Frenchmen. I had met some French people, but they were a couple of cranky spinster schoolteachers. Despite years of "learning" French, by rote, I could neither speak nor understand a word of the language. Furthermore, thanks to articles in Vogue and Hollywood spectaculars, I suspected that France was a nation of icky-picky people where the women were all dainty, exquisitely coiffed, nasty little creatures, the men all Adolphe Menjou-like dandies who twirled their mustaches, pinched girls, and schemed against American rubes. <br><br>I was a six-foot-two-inch, thirty-six-year-old, rather loud and unserious Californian. The sight of France in my porthole was like a giant question mark. <br><br>The America entered Le Havre Harbor slowly. We could see giant cranes, piles of brick, bombed-out empty spaces, and rusting half- sunk hulks left over from the war. As tugs pushed us toward the quay, I peered down from the rail at the crowd on the dock. My gaze stopped on a burly, gruff man with a weathered face and a battered, smoldering cigarette jutting from the corner of his mouth. His giant hands waved about in the air around his head as he shouted something to someone. He was a porter, and he was laughing and heaving luggage around like a happy bear, completely oblivious to me. His swollen belly and thick shoulders were encased in overalls of a distinctive deep blue, a very attractive color, and he had an earthy, amusing quality that began to ease my anxiety. <br><br>So THAT'S what a real Frenchman looks like, I said to myself. He's hardly Adolphe Menjou. Thank goodness, there are actual blood-and- guts people in this country! <br><br>By 7:00 a.m., Paul and I were ashore and our bags had passed through customs. For the next two hours, we sat there smoking and yawning, with our collars turned up against the drizzle. Finally, a crane pulled our large sky-blue Buick station wagon-which we'd nicknamed "the Blue Flash"-out of the ship's hold. The Buick swung overhead in a sling and then dropped down to the dock, where it landed with a bounce. It was immediately set upon by a gang of m�caniciens, men dressed in black berets, white butcher's aprons, and big rubber boots. They filled the Flash with essence, oil, and water, affixed our diplomatic license plates, and stowed our fourteen pieces of luggage and half a dozen trunks and blankets away all wrong. Paul tipped them, and restowed the bags so that he could see out the back window. He was very particular about his car-packing, and very good at it, too, like a master jigsaw-puzzler. <br><br>As he finished stowing, the rain eased and streaks of blue emerged from the gray scud overhead. We wedged ourselves into the front seat and pointed our wide, rumbling nose southeast, toward Paris. <br><br><b>II. Sole Meuni�re </b><br><br>The Norman countryside struck me as quintessentially French, in an indefinable way. The real sights and sounds and smells of this place were so much more particular and interesting than a movie montage or a magazine spread about "France" could ever be. Each little town had a distinct character, though some of them, like Yvetot, were still scarred by gaping bomb holes and knots of barbed wire. We saw hardly any other cars, but there were hundreds of bicyclists, old men driving horses-and-buggies, ladies dressed in black, and little boys in wooden shoes. The telephone poles were of a different size and shape from those in America. The fields were intensely cultivated. There were no billboards. And the occasional pink-and-white stucco villa set at the end of a formal all�e of trees was both silly and charming. Quite unexpectedly, something about the earthy-smoky smells, the curve of the landscape, and the bright greenness of the cabbage fields reminded us both of China. <br><br>Oh, la belle France-without knowing it, I was already falling in love! <br><br>At twelve-thirty we Flashed into Rouen. We passed the city's ancient and beautiful clock tower, and then its famous cathedral, still pockmarked from battle but magnificent with its stained-glass windows. We rolled to a stop in la Place du Vieux March�, the square where Joan of Arc had met her fiery fate. There the Guide Michelin directed us to Restaurant La Couronne ("The Crown"), which had been built in 1345 in a medieval quarter-timbered house. Paul strode ahead, full of anticipation, but I hung back, concerned that I didn't look chic enough, that I wouldn't be able to communicate, and that the waiters would look down their long Gallic noses at us Yankee tourists. <br><br>It was warm inside, and the dining room was a comfortably old- fashioned brown-and-white space, neither humble nor luxurious. At the far end was an enormous fireplace with a rotary spit, on which something was cooking that sent out heavenly aromas. We were greeted by the ma�tre d'h&#x18;...</p><h2>Battlefield of the Mind for Teens (Battlefield of the Mind for Teens Winning the Battle in your Min</h2><p>This book by Joyce Meyer takes an honest look at what teenagers face every day - peer pressure, expectations for your future, the struggle for independence.

Collected for the first time are Wallace's first published story, "The View from Planet Trillaphon as Seen In Relation to the Bad Thing" and a selection of his work as a writing instructor, including reading lists, grammar guides, and general guidelines for his students.<br><br>A dozen writers and critics, including Hari Kunzru, Anne Fadiman, and Nam Le, add afterwords to favorite pieces, expanding our appreciation of the unique pleasures of Wallace's writing. The result is an astonishing volume that shows the breadth and range of "one of America's most daring and talented writers" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>) whose work was full of humor, insight, and beauty.</p><p>David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, in 1962 and raised in Illinois, where he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He received bachelor of arts degrees in philosophy and English from Amherst College and wrote what would become his first novel, <em>The Broom of the System</em>, as his senior English thesis. He received a masters of fine arts from University of Arizona in 1987 and briefly pursued graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University. His second novel,<em> Infinite Jest</em>, was published in 1996. Wallace taught creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College, and published the story collections <em>Girl with Curious Hair</em>, <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>, <em>Oblivion, </em>the essay collections <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,</em> and <em>Consider the Lobster</em>. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award, and a Whiting Writers' Award, and was appointed to the Usage Panel for The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He died in 2008. His last novel, <em>The Pale King</em>, was published in 2011."The best of the best."&#x2015;<b><i>Elissa Schappell, <em>Vanity Fair</em></i></b><br><br>"[An] intriguing collection.... What comes through clearly in the Reader is not just his originality and gorgeous prose but also Wallace's humor."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Dujour</em></i></b><br><br>"And now arrives this thumping great book.... A heady reminder of why we got hooked in the first place.... Wallace...had an incredible ear for the quirks and tics of spoken American - and...that is on virtuosic display throughout this Reader."&#x2015;<b><i>Duncan White, <i>The Telegraph</i></i></b><br><br>"The time is right for THE DAVID FOSTER WALLACE READER.... As a reintroduction, or even introduction, to Mr. Wallace...it's a reminder of what a transgressive, digressive delight he could be. For teachers, it's a textbook geared to orthodoxy-free students who can pierce the carapace of Mr. Wallace's reputation and read his work with fresh eyes. And even for those who race through it, it's a jolt of sheer genius - and a horror. There are immense, intricate, leisurely pleasures to be had here, and they should not be glimpsed like the landscape from a speeding train."&#x2015;<b><i>Janet Maslin, <i>New York Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Does a fantastic job of surveying Wallace's work."&#x2015;<b><i>Jonathan Russell Clark, <i>The Millions</i></i></b><br><br>"A reminder of how good Wallace could be, whether he was writing about Kafka or the Illinois State Fair, whether he was making stuff up or trying to see things as they actually are."&#x2015;<b><i>Alexander Nazaryan, <i>Newsweek</i></i></b></p><h2>Rogue Strike (A Jake Keller Thriller)</h2><p><b>Jake Keller finds himself in a familiar position&#x2014;on the run for his life and desperate to find the shadowy figures behind a global conspiracy.</b><br><br>CIA agent Jake Keller and his partner, Curt Roach, are in Yemen on an important mission. They've been tipped off to a secret meeting of top al Qaeda leaders. The plan is to interrupt the meeting with a few unexpected visitors&#x2014;a pair of Hellfire missiles from an orbiting drone. But the drone stops responding to their signals and soon disappears over the horizon. When next seen, the drone is attacking innocent pilgrims in Mecca.&nbsp;<br><br>Jake and Curt are staggered. The U.S. government is desperate to disavow this atrocity. Who better to blame than a couple of rogue CIA agents? With all the governments of the Middle East looking for them and no help from their own side, they are in a desperate race to stay ahead of the mob and find out who's actually behind the crime.</p><p>A keen outdoorsman, <b>David Ricciardi </b>incorporated many personal experiences into his work. He's backpacked through the mountains of the western United States and Alaska, received extensive training from law enforcement and U.S. special operations personnel, and once woke up for a two A.M. watch aboard a sailboat only to discover that it was headed the wrong way through the Atlantic sea-lanes in heavy weather, with one of the crew suffering from hypothermia. In addition to being an avid sailor, David is also a certified scuba rescue diver and a former ski instructor.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2018 David Ricciardi<br><br><p></p><p>1</p><p>The two men in the bed of the old pickup told the driver to step on it&#x2014;they could survive a rough ride.</p><p>They might not survive being late.</p><p>Two days earlier, a signals intercept had revealed an upcoming meeting involving the number one target on the U.S. government&#x2019;s disposition matrix. Known as Mullah Muktar, he was a quasi-religious leader who&#x2019;d helped plan the September 11th attacks, then risen to become the leader of a violent extremist organization known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.</p><p>And it was time to send him to Paradise.</p><p>A wake of dust rose behind the pickup truck as it pounded over the dirt road. The monsoon rains usually turned the Wadi Bana into a flowing river that made life in Southern Yemen almost tolerable for a few months each year, but the rains had been light this season. The land was hard and dry.</p><p>The driver switched on his lights as he turned onto a paved road. The town of Zinjibar loomed in the cracked windshield. Most of its buildings had been destroyed in the war. The air smelled of smoke and a fine dust that never quite settled to the ground.</p><p>The senior CIA officer slapped the roof twice as they passed an open-air market. The pickup turned into an alley and slowed. He threw a goatskin satchel over his shoulder and jumped down to the street.</p><p>Two blocks away, the second officer hopped out. He was dressed in a mishmash of loose-fitting pants and a faded wool coat that was popular with the locals. He stooped over and feigned a slight limp, hoping that darkness and distance would make him look like one of the many old men who carried their wares to the market each morning.</p><p>Game time, Zac, he thought to himself.</p><p>Then he grimaced.</p><p>Zac&#x2019;s gone.</p><p>He was known as Jake Keller now, and on his first mission as part of the Agency&#x2019;s elite Special Activities Center. He walked back to the main boulevard and climbed a pile of rubble to enter an abandoned apartment building. His partner was already there, standing in the dark with a scruffy beard, a scarf wrapped around his head, and a stubby AKS-74U rifle in his hands.</p><p>Curt Roach, a thirty-eight year old former special operations marine, was nine years older than Jake and had worked in the military or CIA his entire adult life. He hid a battery-powered motion detector in the lobby and motioned to the stairway. Jake unclipped his own rifle from a harness under his jacket and unfolded the wire stock. The two men ascended the concrete stairs in silence and cleared each room in the five-story building.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get set up,&#x201d; Roach said. &#x201c;This thing could go down any minute.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake hung camouflage netting from the ceiling, five feet back from the outside wall. Roach set up a tripod behind the net.</p><p>&#x201c;Pass me the designator.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake handed him what looked like a high-tech pair of binoculars. The device would bounce a beam of invisible infrared light off whatever it was pointed at. It could determine the target&#x2019;s coordinates or guide a missile onto it from an aircraft circling above.</p><p>&#x201c;Run the antennas?&#x201d; Jake said as he scratched his beard.</p><p>Roach nodded. &#x201c;Just be sure they can&#x2019;t be seen from the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake disappeared up the stairs, trailing a thin cable behind him. He returned a few minutes later.</p><p>&#x201c;SATCOM and GPS are up. I&#x2019;ll check in,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, Mustang, this is Cobra.&#x201d;</p><p>From a top-secret facility halfway across the Arabian Peninsula, the CIA mission control element responded.</p><p>&#x201c;Cobra, go for Mustang.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, Cobra at position Alpha.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Copy position Alpha. Strike package is two ships. Drifter-71 and Drifter-72 are hard altitude eighteen thousand feet and orbiting your position with fifteen hours till bingo.&#x201d;</p><p>High overhead, two unmanned combat aerial vehicles flew racetrack patterns around the city. From a distance, the stealthy, bat-winged UCAVs resembled miniature B-2 bombers. They each carried fifteen hours of fuel and a pair of air-to-ground missiles in an internal weapons bay.</p><p>The two CIA officers watched the streets for hours until a battered Nissan pickup truck arrived, spewing black smoke from its diesel engine. Six men with rifles hopped down. After suffering through decades of a multiparty civil war, nearly everyone in Yemen had a gun, but these men positioned themselves around the intersection with overlapping fields of fire on all of the approaches.</p><p>Curt reached for the SATCOM. He whispered despite being two hundred meters away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, we have six military-age males in the open at Alpha. Definite weapons and tactical movement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that, Cobra,&#x201d; said the radio. &#x201c;Be advised we are tracking three vehicles westbound to your position.&#x201d;</p><p>A heavily muscled man in fatigue pants and a black T-shirt stared up at the nearby buildings. His gaze shifted methodically, right to left, top to bottom, looking for anything out of the ordinary. Despite having the early morning sun in his eyes, he paused at the floor where Jake and Curt were holed up. He started walking toward the Americans&#x2019; building when three identical SUVs stopped in the intersection.</p><p>Mullah Muktar emerged from the third vehicle.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, we have Jupiter at Alpha,&#x201d; Roach said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s linking up with the six dismounts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger, Cobra,&#x201d; said mission control. &#x201c;Facial recognition confirms positive ID on Jupiter. Drifter-72 in range. Ten hours till bingo. Mustang standing by.&#x201d;</p><p>The man in the fatigue pants escorted Muktar into the building across the street.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, a tan Yemeni government Land Rover arrived and four soldiers climbed out. A civilian wearing an open-necked suit emerged from the passenger seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;There goes our operation.&#x201d;</p><p>Roach scowled. The Agency&#x2019;s rules of engagement prohibited any action that jeopardized the safety of Yemeni government personnel. He picked up the radio.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, we have Saturn in a tan government truck with a four-man security detail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would government forces drive that truck into al-Qaeda territory?&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;Those two have been at each other&#x2019;s throats for years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because those aren&#x2019;t government forces,&#x201d; Roach said. &#x201c;These guys know our ROE and they&#x2019;re using them against us. Look at Saturn&#x2019;s security detail. They&#x2019;re looking for external threats. Legitimate government forces would be watching Muktar&#x2019;s men. The truck is a hoax.&#x201d;</p><p>Roach looked through the laser designator&#x2019;s magnified optics as the man in the open-necked suit entered the building.</p><p>&#x201c;Jupiter and Saturn are inside the target,&#x201d; Roach said.</p><p>&#x201c;Cobra, government personnel are outside the ROE. Drifter-71 will target Jupiter&#x2019;s vehicle once he clears the area.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Negative, Mustang. The truck is a ruse,&#x201d; Roach said. &#x201c;These bastards killed three thousand Americans and now it&#x2019;s payback time. Spin up your missiles.&#x201d;</p><p>The man in the fatigue pants returned to the street and linked up with another man. They started walking toward Jake and Roach&#x2019;s building.</p><p>&#x201c;You see this?&#x201d; Jake said as he picked up his rifle.</p><p>Roach nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you want to hit Muktar&#x2019;s truck after he leaves?&#x201d; Jake asked. &#x201c;Just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First, there&#x2019;s zero chance that those are government troops. They never made it past the al-Qaeda checkpoints. Second, the mullah has been dodging drone strikes for years. As soon as those vehicles start rolling, his goons will play a shell game with them. The odds of a successful mission go down by two-thirds the second he gets in that truck.&#x201d;</p><p>The radio chirped again. &#x201c;Roger, Cobra. Drifter-72 is in range and holding on station. Prepare to provide terminal guidance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Negative on the terminal guidance,&#x201d; Roach said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got hostiles inbound. We&#x2019;re going to transmit coordinates instead.&#x201d;</p><p>In terminal guidance mode, the designator would send coded pulses of laser light that would guide the drone&#x2019;s missiles to the target, but Roach and Jake would have to stay in position for the duration of the operation, and Roach was worried about the man in the camo pants.</p><p>Roach pressed several buttons on the designator and keyed the SATCOM.</p><p>&#x201c;Cobra transmitting coordinates now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You are cleared hot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good copy on coordinates, Cobra. Missile launch in three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Roach&#x2019;s watch vibrated. &#x201c;Somebody just triggered the motion detector in the lobby.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake took his rifle to the stairs and listened for the intruders. He glanced at Roach.</p><p>Shouldn&#x2019;t the missiles have hit by now?</p><p>Roach was thinking the same thing.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, repeat, cleared hot. Execute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stand by, Cobra,&#x201d; said the voice on the SATCOM. &#x201c;We are, uh, negative contact with Drifter-72 at this time. Drifter-71 is being retargeted now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell just happened?&#x201d; Jake said.</p><p>Roach shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Cobra, be advised Drifter-71 will be in range in one-six minutes. Maintain position.&#x201d;</p><p>Down in the street below, the two principals exited the meeting.</p><p>Roach keyed the SATCOM. &#x201c;Mustang, we&#x2019;re about to lose both targets.&#x201d;</p><p>The radio was silent as Jupiter and Saturn spoke on the street.</p><p>Jake heard footsteps a few floors below them. He put his rifle to his shoulder and aimed down the stairway.</p><p>Jupiter and Saturn looked like old friends as they exchanged hugs and kisses on both cheeks.</p><p>Jake heard men speaking one floor down and Roach cupped the microphone in his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, Mustang&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Repeat, we are losing both targets.&#x201d;</p><p>The voices stopped. Roach picked up his rifle.</p><p>Two minutes later, the man in the fatigue pants and his partner appeared on the street next to Mullah Muktar.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been chasing that sonofabitch for almost twenty years and he&#x2019;s going to walk again,&#x201d; Roach said. He practically shouted into the mic. &#x201c;Mustang, this is Cobra. Jupiter and Saturn are bugging out. Does Drifter-71 have eyes on target yet?&#x201d;</p><p>The men on the street entered their vehicles. Roach hammered the SATCOM with his fist.</p><p>&#x201c;Mustang, this is Cobra, how copy?&#x201d; he said as the terrorists drove away.</p><p>He switched off the designator and sat back against the wall. He kicked the SATCOM across the floor and looked at Jake.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call for extraction once it&#x2019;s dark.&#x201d;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>The cameraman usually covered soccer matches for the Al-Arabiya television network, but the equipment today was the same, the best that money could buy. He could capture a million people in the frame or zoom in on a single face. Ultra-high-definition sensors rendered flawless images of whatever he&#x2019;d selected. The control booth would occasionally tell him to take an artistic shot and on a clear night he would zoom in on the moon and fill viewers&#x2019; screens with images of craters, ridges, and shadows that most people never knew existed. It was an awesome piece of technology.</p><p>From high atop one of the hotels, he panned right to catch the buses, cars, and pedestrians that were clogging the highway from Mina. They were latecomers making their way back to the Masjid al-Haram, the enormous outdoor mosque in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It was the last day of the Hajj, and they were obligated to enter the mosque and complete the final tawaf, seven laps around the black building in the center known as the Kaaba. Only then would Allah erase their sins and their pilgrimage be complete.</p><p>Covering the Hajj was easy work for the cameraman, except for the heat, which could run to 130 or 140 degrees Fahrenheit on the roof. He downed another bottle of water and zoomed in on the profile of a single pilgrim, prostrate before the Kaaba with his hands pressed up against its stone side. Tears of joy streamed down the man&#x2019;s face as the song of the muezzin appeared to be directed only to him. It was one of the cameraman&#x2019;s favorite shots. He focused on the individual for several seconds.</p><p>The tearful man raised his head and the cameraman began to zoom out. He widened the frame until it included the dozen or so people closest to the pilgrim, symbolizing the man&#x2019;s family. He kept widening the picture until perhaps a hundred people were in the shot, representing the pilgrim&#x2019;s community. The cameraman kept zooming out until viewers could see the tawaf, rotating counterclockwise like a great galaxy of Islam. The final shot encompassed the entire Grand Mosque with the Kaaba drawing the viewer&#x2019;s eyes to the center. It was breathtaking. The booth usually held it for twenty or thirty seconds before cutting to a different angle. The cameraman lifted his eyes from his viewfinder and looked out over the scene, savoring the moment.</p><p>There was an explosion in the crowd, followed by a cloud of smoke rising into the air near the Kaaba. The crying man was gone, vaporized along with at least a thousand people around him.</p><p>Oh, no, thought the cameraman. Some madman snuck in a bomb. Is nowhere sacred?</p><p>There was a second explosion and more smoke on the other side of the Kaaba. There was more smoke. And then he heard the sound, the whoosh of two objects flying rapidly through the air, followed by the noise of the explosions.</p><p>Delayed by the speed of sound, he realized. Not a madman on the ground, but a madman in the air&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The cameraman instinctively spun the camera toward the action. Its powerful lens picked up faint trails of smoke. He followed them into the sky and zoomed in until he spotted a dot in the distance. He zoomed as fast and as far as he could until the dot took form, the form of an aircraft turning away. The image was grainy on the hot and hazy summer day, but the cameraman had no doubts about what it was. The distinctive, bat-winged aircraft was possessed by only one nation on earth, and millions of people had just seen it attack the holiest site in all of Islam.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell does &#x2018;negative contact&#x2019; mean? Did the UCAV crash?&#x201d; Jake said.</p><p>Roach just scowled. He&#x2019;d been wondering the same thing and the CIA mission control element wasn&#x2019;t responding.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check the east side of the building,&#x201d; Jake said, more out of frustration than anything else. He took his rifle.</p><p>It was early afternoon, the Yemeni equivalent of a siesta, when much of the male population was out on the street. Despite the heat, most were dressed in baggy trousers, blousy shirts, and camel hair coats, often with loose turbans wrapped around their heads. Many carried a curved dagger, known locally as a jambiya, tucked in their waists. Once a fearsome weapon, the jambiya had become largely ceremonial over the last few decades. For serious work, nearly everyone had a Kalashnikov in his hand, on his shoulder, or leaning against a nearby wall.</p><p>Most of the idlers were chewing a locally grown stimulant called qat and visiting with their neighbors, but there were others, groups of men with long beards and unblinking eyes. They were al-Qaeda soldiers, and the locals usually gave them a wide berth.</p><p>But something was different today. The qat chewers were agitated. Jake raised his binoculars.

She lives in Dorset, England, where she spent thirty years restoring the garden of an old rectory. She has recently moved to a new house and started another garden. She is married and has three daughters.Pavord, author of the The Tulip and an expert gardener, traces the history of plant taxonomy from the ancient Greeks to 17th-century British botanist John Ray in this hefty tome, and though her passion for plants is apparent on every page, readers who don't share the same level of enthusiasm will be frustrated by Pavord's encyclopedic approach. Pavord, in prose as rich and colorful as the too-infrequent illustrations, contextualizes plant classification within larger intellectual, political and cultural spheres, but she verges dangerously close to writing a textbook; the vast amount of information she packs into brief, rapid-fire sections can overwhelm. In the best sections, she slows down to draw detailed portraits of researchers and describe how each contributed to the slowly evolving (and, until the late 1600's, unnamed) science of botany. Ray, for instance, marked "a quiet, lonely, dogged consummation" with "no fireworks, no claps of thunder, no swelling symphonic themes" when, shortly before his death and suffering from gangrene, he penned the six fundamental rules of botany. Pavord's prose dazzles, but it's not enough to carry readers with a casual interest in plants or gardening through an otherwise dense history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mostly based on Victorian and Edwardian designs, these patterns feature exquisite paper engineering, including pull-tab butterflies, bouquets, fans, and scrolls; dissolving pictures and kaleidoscopes; and sweet Venetian blind variations. They vary from the very simple to the really intricate, but the step-by-step instructions and diagrams make even the most complicated ones very achievable.&nbsp; Make a puzzle purse, a box stage with musicians playing, and adorable animals in a revolving wheel. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>The tradition of sending loved ones greeting cards goes back about 200 years and is more popular today than ever before. With a greeting card being the gift of choice for so many occasions, people are for ever on the look out for one that the recipient won&#39;t have seen before. Because this is no easy task, the creatively minded amongst us are choosing to make their own cards. There are many books demonstrating how to make basic cards, but this book goes a considerable step further in showing how to make cards with mechanisms. The mechanisms are based on Victorian and Edwardian designs, and vary from the verysimple to the really intricate. But the step-by-step instructions and diagrams provided make even the most complicated form of mechanism achievable. In addition, the materials and equipment needed to make these impressive cards are not extensive or specialist - the main requirements are card, glue and scissors, with wire or thread for the more complex designs.Sheila Sturrock was taught the mechanisms demonstrated in this book by her father during World War II; the projects therefore illusrtrate her lifetime&#39;s interest in paper engineering. Sheila&#39;s skill and craftmanship doesn&#39;t stop there, though; she is also the author of the highly successful Celtic Spirals and Celtic knotwork Designs.</p><h2>Transformers: Retribution</h2><p><b>For decades, <i>Transformers</i> fans across the globe have marveled at the mighty clashes of Megatron and Optimus Prime, and speculated about their arrival on planet Earth.

Williams</b> was born in Hertfordshire, England, and is the author of <i>The Mirrored Heavens, The Burning Skies, </i>and<i> The Machinery of Light</i>. He has previously worked as a writer and concept developer for the award-winning Homeworld franchise of videogames.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Mark S. Williams</b> studied poetry at the University of Maryland before joining the corporate world as a security professional. His previous collaboration with David J. Williams was the short story &#x201c;Maze Run,&#x201d; which appeared in <i>Star Wars Insider</i> magazine. He currently lives in the Midwest, where he can often be found haunting bookstores and pizza parlors when he&#x2019;s not writing.Chapter One<br><br>An endless wall of glittering stars; a single spaceship sweeping in toward it.<br><br>For weeks, the Nemesis had traversed the gulf between two of the Milky Way&#x2019;s spiral arms. Now that journey was almost over. Ahead was the edge of the Orion Arm; that of Sagittarius lay far behind. As the Nemesis gracefully slipped out of faster-than-light mode, its cloaking systems kicked in automatically. Dozens of sensor dishes bloomed like flowers along the titanic warship&#x2019;s spinal mount, scanning the approaching field of stars, processing everything they saw, and relaying their findings to the ship&#x2019;s bridge.<br><br>On the bridge, Starscream and Soundwave studied the readouts. They were the only Decepticons on the flight deck. It didn&#x2019;t take much of a crew to run the ship in standard transit mode, and that was just fine with Starscream. If they found anything, he intended to be the first to know. It wasn&#x2019;t like the ship was going to tell them; the Nemesis had sustained considerable damage during its pursuit of the Auto�bots; not only had it lost the ability to shift out of spaceship mode, it was no longer sentient. The rest of the Decepticons seemed to regard that as a loss, but Starscream relished the fact that the thing had finally shut up. The last thing he needed was a spaceship with its own agenda, for power politics among the Decepticons was complex enough as it was. Let Megatron sulk in his quarters; Starscream would rather watch from the front than give orders from the rear, would rather bide his time, for he knew that after the inevitable victory over the renegade Auto�bots, the real struggle between him and his master would begin. Until that day arrived, he took what satisfaction he could in bullying those below him. He turned his ruby-red eyes on Soundwave and pointed a long finger at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Proceed to secondary scans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At once,&#x201d; Soundwave replied in his usual monotone. Starscream knew there was no need to vocalize what was merely standard operating procedure, but he did it anyway to remind Soundwave that he was second in command on this bridge. He enjoyed reminding all of them every chance he got. Soundwave might be Megatron&#x2019;s loyal pet, but as far as Starscream was concerned, he was nothing more than a jumped-up communications officer with visions of spymaster grandeur, though he was nothing if not obedient: Starscream watched the results from the secondary scans flicker past him. Dozens of screens lit up as the Nemesis searched system after system, star after star&#x2014;a search that now expanded to include substellar material: brown dwarves, burned-out suns, nomad planets, wayward rocks . . .<br><br>There.<br><br>&#x201c;Isolate that signal!&#x201d; Starscream barked. Soundwave was already on it; along one wall, a wraparound screen focused on the system in question, several layers back from the edge of the spiral arm. It was a young star surrounded by a huge cloud of debris. A typical circumstellar disk . . . but Starscream&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, for such debris would be the perfect place for wounded prey to hide. And as the Nemesis&#x2019;s mainframe broke down the signal&#x2019;s composition, Starscream felt an emotion he rarely knew: joy.<br><br>For it was unmistakably an echo from the engines of the Auto�bots&#x2019; Ark.<br><br>Perhaps the Auto�bots were hoping the various debris and gravitational distortions could hide them. If so, they had underestimated the Nemesis&#x2019;s powerful sensors. Back in orbit around Cybertron, it had been a state-of-the-art scientific station while in its Trypticon mode. And now its sensors were put to the test even further: They picked up a second signal, buried still deeper in the mix . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Auto�bot distress call,&#x201d; said Soundwave.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t what Starscream was expecting him to say, but he instinctively hid his surprise. So the Auto�bots were in desperate straits. So much the better. Apparently they were hoping that someone besides the Decepticons was out there to rescue them from whatever they&#x2019;d stumbled into. Pathetic, Starscream thought. They weren&#x2019;t warriors by trade; they could boast of nothing approaching the instinctive grasp of tactics possessed by every Decepticon. There were times he almost felt sorry for them. It wasn&#x2019;t their fault that they hadn&#x2019;t been born for battle. Yet they&#x2019;d made matters worse for themselves by entrusting their leadership to a glorified data clerk. That the no-name Orion Pax could become Optimus Prime was offensive to every self-respecting Decepticon. His leading the Auto�bots to their demise was only a matter of time.<br><br>Now that time had arrived.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall I alert Lord Megatron?&#x201d; Soundwave asked.<br><br>Starscream thought for a moment. &#x201c;No. You stay here and monitor the signal. If it changes in any way, contact me immediately. I shall go and alert Lord Megatron myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As you wish, Air Commander.&#x201d;<br><br>Megatron had little use for amenities.<br><br>He&#x2019;d declined to use the captain&#x2019;s quarters as his lair, instead opting to set up his command post in a massive observation bubble that sat high atop one of the Nemesis&#x2019;s aft superstructures. In peacetime, that bubble had been the site of telescopes that charted faraway stars, but all such equipment had been jettisoned long ago, making it the perfect place for Megatron to brood and plan high above the troops he commanded deep in the bowels of the vessel. The Decepticon leader had felt the ship drop out of lightspeed and knew that very soon those subordinates would be clamoring for orders.<br><br>For they were nothing without orders. There was no way they&#x2019;d ever have gotten this far without him. Although each Deception was an excellent fighter in his own right, working together just wasn&#x2019;t something that came naturally to them. They needed a strong hand to guide them to victory. Nor was it simply a matter of each Decepticon recognizing where his collective interest lay. It was far more basic than that&#x2014;it was might makes right, the purest expression of the Decepticon credo, and everything Megatron did reinforced the fact that he was the mightiest of all. There would always be pretenders to the throne, but what was leadership without the occasional opportunity to grind would-be usurpers down to their basic components? It was a part of the game that Megatron relished.<br><br>Though such satisfaction fell far short of the pleasure he would know on the day he crushed the Auto�bots and personally destroyed Optimus Prime. It vexed Megatron greatly that the librarian had escaped his clutches thus far. Only luck had allowed that rebellious bot to escape Cybertron in the first place. But luck could take one only so far. As of late a new factor had entered the equation&#x2014;after their clash at Junkion, Megatron reluctantly had to admit to himself that the data clerk was fast learning the art of war. No doubt about it, Optimus&#x2019;s possession of the ancient Matrix of Leadership was making a difference. The Auto�bot leader had grown into his rule; he had led Megatron on quite a chase, but he couldn&#x2019;t run forever. Sooner or later he would have to stand up and fight. And probably sooner . . . The sound of the door chime pulled Megatron back from his thoughts.<br><br>&#x201c;Enter,&#x201d; he said. Starscream strode into Megatron&#x2019;s chambers, dropped down to one knee, and bowed his head to his leader in a gesture that&#x2014;though technically quite correct&#x2014;bordered on the mocking.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh mighty Lord Megatron, it is my humble duty to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dispense with the pleasantries,&#x201d; said Megatron. &#x201c;And get to the point before I decide your service is no longer required.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve found the Auto�bots, Lord Megatron.&#x201d; Starscream keyed up the data on a screen in the observation module. &#x201c;The system is awash with debris, but we&#x2019;re sure this is an Auto�bot transponder.&#x201d;<br><br>Megatron studied the display. His traditional scowl shifted to a wry half smile, but he said nothing. As the silence lengthened, Starscream started to get a little anxious.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think, sire?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>The half smile became a full one. &#x201c;I think the Auto�bots have set a cunning trap,&#x201d; said Megatron.<br><br>&#x201c;A trap? For us? Impossible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always underestimated the Auto�bots, Starscream. One day that arrogance will be your undoing. They may not be born warriors, but they are more than capable of deceiving the likes of you.&#x201d; The screen on the wall expanded out into a hologram. &#x201c;Look more closely; do you see it this time?&#x201d;<br><br>Starscream was definitely nervous now. He had no idea what Megatron was talking about. He shook his head, wishing Megatron would stop talking in riddles. The Decepticon leader let out a low sound that was half growl, half chuckle. He pointed at a series of coordinates around the site of the transponder.<br><br>&#x201c;You forget, the Nemesis is purely automated intelligence. It cannot rival my judgment. These look like reflections from the primary source, but they are almost certainly heat signatures as well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Starscream said.<br><br>&#x201c;They could be ships, fool. Using the debris as cover for an ambush. They think if they can trap us between the star and the debris field, they&#x2019;ll be able to maximize their weaker numbers against our stronger force. They know that the Ark is no match for the Nemesis and that the radiation in this debris field will play havoc with our targeting systems. So they&#x2019;re trying to even up the odds. And had you been in charge instead of me, it might have worked.&#x201d;<br><br>Starscream ignored the barb. &#x201c;So what should we do, my lord?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spring the trap, of course. Set the ship to condition red. We&#x2019;ll finish this once and for all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At once, my lord.&#x201d; Starscream hesitated. &#x201c;And how shall we spring this trap?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We? Try you. Take a detachment of your best Seekers.&#x201d;<br><br>Starscream didn&#x2019;t like the sound of that at all. He tried to think fast.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord, I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m worthy of such an honor.&#x201d;<br><br>Megatron laughed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so hard on yourself,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>The Nemesis&#x2019;s wardroom was a popular place for the Decepticon warriors to replenish their Energon, talk shop, argue tactics&#x2014;and, of course, gossip about their leaders. But even away from the front lines, Decepticon hierarchy was very much in evidence. Thundercracker and several others in Starscream&#x2019;s combat air patrol treated the place as their personal lounge. The less hearty of the Decepticons usually cleared out when they appeared in force to crowd around the rechargers and oil kegs. Thrust, Dirge, and Ramjet spent most of their time arguing over who was the better Seeker while Skywarp fine-tuned the circuitry on his teleportation unit. As of late, the scuttlebutt had centered on the increasingly boring system-by-system search for the Auto�bot enemies: How long would it go on? Would they ever find their quarry?<br><br>Not that anyone was so unwise as to express such sentiments to Megatron. The Decepticon leader kept his own counsel, and no one second-guessed it unless he wanted a good old-fashioned laser blast to the head. Though there had been plenty of talk behind his back about what he was up to. Because whatever Megatron had been doing these last few weeks was strange&#x2014;it was almost as if he&#x2019;d been told the direction in which to search but not how far out he had to go. Following a more or less straight line, the Nemesis had systematically made its way across the galaxy, all the way to the edge . . . and then it had just kept going, out into the void, crossing to the next spiral arm. Perhaps Megatron was chasing phantoms. Perhaps he had become too obsessed with his hunt. Perhaps he was losing it. No one said that out loud&#x2014;not even to one another&#x2014;but it was on all their minds. That was the problem with dictators&#x2014;it was an efficient way to do business, but it all fell to pieces when they started making poor decisions. More than one bot aboard the Nemesis was beginning to wish he&#x2019;d stayed behind on Cybertron. There were those among the naysayers who hinted at disaster . . .<br><br>Thundercracker had no such qualms. He was quite happy to follow Megatron wherever he might lead, particularly since remaining on Cybertron with Shockwave had few attractions. The scientist-regent was about as unpredictable as a Decepticon could get, but if past was prologue, it surely involved experiments on his own kind with little regard for the end result. Thundercracker privately hoped that Shockwave would meet with a reckoning when Megatron returned home in triumph. But those were concerns for another time indeed.<br><br>Because now an alarm was sounding throughout the ship.<br><br>Thundercracker glanced at the others in the room. Suddenly they were all on edge, like athletes waiting for the signal to go. The intercom buzzed to life.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Air Commander Starscream. All Seekers, prepare for orbital assault.&#x201d;<br><br>An excited buzz ran around the wardroom. Surely that meant the Auto�bots had been found. Thundercracker stood up and spoke to the room in tones that rang down the corridors and that (he hoped) were overheard by their glorious leader.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to do what we do best! Thanks to Megatron for delivering us this chance at battle! All hail Megatron!&#x201d;<br><br>The answering shout would have deafened anything that wasn&#x2019;t metal. &#x201c;ALL HAIL MEGATRON!&#x201d;<br><br>Soundwave snapped to attention as Megatron strode onto the Nemesis&#x2019;s command deck.<br><br>&#x201c;Status report,&#x201d; Megatron barked.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve isolated the transmission&#x2019;s location, Lord Megatron.&#x201d; Soundwave quickly set the ship&#x2019;s viewscreens to display all the information he&#x2019;d obtained regarding the mysterious system and the signal emanating from it. Megatron frowned.<br><br>&#x201c;And your personal analysis, Soundwave?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The signal is of Auto�bot origin. That being said, I still cannot locate the exact position of the Auto�bot Ark. The debris serves as effective cover, complicating any effort at triangulation&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, yes. I understand.&#x201d; Megatron smiled as he stared at the screen. &#x201c;Well played, librarian, well played indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What should we do, my lord?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Starscream has volunteered to attack immediately. We will bring the Nemesis to the system&#x2019;s edge and prepare to support him.&#x201d;<br><br>Soundwave hesitated. &#x201c;Do you think it wise to send so small a detachment in first, sire?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is what Starscream and his Seekers were built for,&#x201d; Megatron said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be on top of that signal faster than the Auto�bots will be able to react. Optimus will have to reveal his precise location, and then we&#x2019;ll move in with the main force and strike.&#x201d;<br><br>That made sense to Soundwave. Exposing Starscream to the brunt of the enemy made even more. If he&#x2019;d had a sense of humor, he would have giggled.<br><br>Fortunately for those around him, he didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Down in one of the Nemesis&#x2019;s forward loading bays the Seekers got ready. Starscream, Thundercracker, Skywarp, Thrust, Dirge, and Ramjet were finishing their final weapon checks.<br><br>&#x201c;So let me get this straight,&#x201d; said Ramjet, shrugging his blue steel shoulders. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to go in there and spring what may very well be a trap?&#x201d;<br><br>Thrust laughed. &#x201c;Feeling nervous, Ramjet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m just wondering why we have to stick our head into the meat grinder,&#x201d; Ramjet said. &#x201c;Surely we should lead with a decoy. It hardly seems like the kind of assault work we Seekers merit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A far cry from when we ruled the skies of Cybertron,&#x201d; Dirge added. &#x201c;This sounds almost like we&#x2019;re being used as cannon fodder. I wish to protest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wish all you like!&#x201d; Starscream bellowed. He&#x2019;d resigned himself to the situation&#x2014;there was no choice other than to get with the program and hope for the best. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going in first because we&#x2019;re the elite, okay? When you want something done right, you deploy your finest troops. Agreed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Agreed,&#x201d; said Thundercracker. &#x201c;Anyway, who wants to sit around here when there&#x2019;s the chance o...</p><h2>The Foundation Trilogy: Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation</h2><p>A transcript of the BBC&#39;s radio adaptation of The foundation trilogy.</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920&#x2013;1992), one of the &#x201c;Big Three&#x201d; science fiction masters of his time (along with Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke), is best known for his Robot, Galactic Empire, and Foundation series.<br><br>Michael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning critic for <i>The Washington Post </i>and the author of the memoir <i>An Open Book </i>and of four collections of essays: <i>Readings, Bound to Please, Book by Book, </i>and <i>Classics for Pleasure.<br></i>From the Introduction by Michael Dirda<br><br>It is late summer, 1941. A young Jewish intellectual, an admirer of Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, suddenly finds himself musing about historical determinism, individual initiative and the ideal society. Why did Rome fall? Was the Christian religion a means of preserving ancient culture? What forms of government and economic system are best for mankind? Democratic representation with capitalistic competition? Enlightened despotism? A meritocracy of the best and the brightest?<br><br>Having come of age in 1930s' New York, the young intellectual would have heard fervent Trotskyites on street corners proclaim that history advances through class struggle and through the conflict between evolving political and economic ideologies. He already knew that Arnold Toynbee, in <i>A Study of History</i>, contended that civilizations have their seasons &#x2014; they rise, grow stagnant without sufficient challenges, eventually decay and fall. Still other thinkers, among them H.G. Wells, were convinced that the world should be governed by scientists, with rational benevolence. Wasn't that the theme of the recent movie, <i>Things to Come</i> (1936), with its vision of a perfectly ordered, chrome-bright "world of tomorrow"?<br><br>Still, all these systems and theories made historical change seem a cut-and-dried affair, quite logical, utterly inevitable. Yet where was the individual in these grand schemes of Marx and Toynbee and Wells? If only impersonal forces determined the course of events, how did one account for a Hitler?&nbsp; An upstart from nowhere, he had manipulated the German people with a mesmerist's power, promulgated a manifest destiny for his chosen elite, declared a Thousand-Year Reich. Clearly, the so-called F�hrer viewed himself as a Great Man, able to reshape his time as did Alexander and Napoleon before him. Such overreachers truly make history, don't they?<br><br>So Isaac Asimov, a twenty-one-year-old Columbia graduate, must have thought and wondered when he sat down at his typewriter that summer of 1941. However, what the young writer eventually produced was neither a turgid sociological tract nor a summa of world history. Instead, through a series of stories, Asimov tracked the breakdown of a smug conspicuously rich and stultified civilization, while also portraying the efforts of a highly committed group of activists to hasten the birth of a new and more glorious future society. In effect, he took the central myth of the 1930s and '40s &#x2014; lived out and believed in by Communists, Fascists, the International Brigade and New Deal Democrats alike &#x2014; and re-imagined it, with spaceships, in a galaxy far, far away. Science fiction is, after all, the art of extrapolation.<br><br>By the time Asimov brought his much loved series to a halt in 1949, he had written eight stories and novellas depicting the collapse of a Galactic Empire, the war-torn feudal period that followed, and the mysterious Foundation established to preserve civilization in a time of barbarism. Gathered together into book form &#x2014; what SF fans call a "fix-up" &#x2014; the stories required three volumes: <i>Foundation </i>(1951), <i>Foundation and Empire</i> (1952) and&nbsp; <i>Second Foundation </i>(1953). At the 1955 World Science Fiction Convention this trilogy was enthusiastically voted "the greatest all-time science-fiction series." Period. In the view of many, the assembled sequence also represents a watershed in literary history. A noted SF editor Donald Wollheim quickly realized: "Stores published before <i>Foundation</i> belong to the old line, the stories published after belong to 'modern' science fiction."<br><br>*<br><br>Isaac Asimov (1920-92) grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. Something of a whiz kid, he graduated early from high school and attended Columbia University, first as an undergraduate and later as a biochemistry graduate student. After earning his Ph. D., he taught for many years at Boston University before giving up the academic life in 1958 to become a full-time writer.<br><br>As a teenager, Asimov had been a devoted reader of the pulp magazines at his father's candy store: <i>Wonder Stories</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. In their pages one could follow the galactic adventures of E. E. "Doc" Smith's "Skylark of Space," shudder at "The Human Pets of Mars" and fight alongside "Tumithak of the Corridors." Before long, the teenaged Asimov begun to crank out his own short stories; the first to be published "Marooned on Vest," appearing in <i>Amazing</i> in 1939. After many rejections, he shortly thereafter broke into <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; the premier magazine in the field &#x2014; with "Trends" (originally titled, with a&nbsp; kind of clairvoyance, "Ad Astra" &#x2014; i.e., "to the stars"). That "yarn" appeared in the same July 1939 issue as A. E. van Vogt's first story ("Black Destroyer," almost certainly a partial inspiration for the film <i>Alien</i>) and only a month before Robert A. Heinlein's first story, "Lifeline." thus began the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which would last until roughly 1950.<br><br>Asimov developed quickly as a writer. He sold "Robbie," his first robot story, to <i>Super Science Stories</i> in 1940 (where its title was changed to "Strange Playfellow"), and his later ones to <i>Astounding</i>. Asimov always claimed it was John. W. Campbell, Jr., that magazine's legendary editor, who devised the central "Three Laws of Robotics" during a conversation at the end of 1940:<br><br>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br><br>By 1941, Asimov was ready for what would prove his <i>annus mirabilis</i>. On March 17, when this still very young writer was visiting the <i>Astounding</i> offices, Campbell unexpectedly quoted a passage from Emerson: "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God . . ." What, the magazine editor wondered, would happen to people who suddenly saw stars for the first time? Asimov said he didn't know. Campbell answered: "I think they would go mad. I want you to write a story about that."<br><br>According to the first volume of his autobiography, <i>In Memory Yet Green</i>, Asimov began the story on March 18, 1941 and finished it on April 8. "Nightfall," as he called it, was then published as the cover story for the September issue of <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; along with the conclusion of Robert Heinlein's short novel <i>Methuselah's Children</i> and in the company of Alfred Bester's now classic "Adam and No Eve." Since that day, "Nightfall" has been judged, over and over again, to be the greatest science-fiction story ever written. Happily neither Heinlein nor Bester would ever complain about this, since the former quickly established himself as the best science-fiction writer of all time and the latter's 1956 novel, <i>The Stars My Destination</i>, is widely and rightly, viewed as the best single SF novel ever written.<br><br>Having formulated the Laws of Robotics and then written "Nightfall," one might assume that young Asimov would devote the rest of his time to his studies. Hardly. That fall <i>Astounding</i> also brought out the first two Foundation stories. Years later, Asimov recalled the genesis of the series:<br><br><i>On August 1, 1941, I took the subway to Campbell's office after class was over. On the way down I racked my brain for a story idea. Failing, I tried a device I sometimes used. I opened a book at random and then tried free association, beginning with whatever I first saw. <br><br>The book I had with me was a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays. I opened it to </i>Iolanthe <i>&#x2014; to the picture of the Fairy Queen throwing herself at the feet of Private Willis, the sentry. Thinking of sentries, I thought of soldiers, of military empires, of the Roman Empire &#x2014; of the Galactic Empire &#x2014; aha! . . ."<br><br>Why should I not write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and the return of feudalism, written from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? I thought I knew how to do it for I had read Edward Gibbon's </i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire<i> from first page to last at least twice, and I had only to make use of that.<br><br>I was bubbling over by the time I got to Campbell's, and my enthusiasm was catching. It was perhaps too catching for Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do. <br><br>"That's too large a theme for a short story," he said.<br><br>"I was thinking of a novelette," I said, quickly, adjusting my thoughts.<br><br>"Or a novelette. It will have to be an open-ended series of short stories."<br><br>"What?" I said, weakly.<br><br>"Short stories, novelettes, serials, all fitting into a particular future history, involving the fall of the First Galactic Empire, the period of feudalism that follows and the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.<br><br>"What?" I said, even more weakly. <br><br>"Yes, I want you to write an outline for the future history. Go home and write an outline."<br><br>There Campbell had made a mistake. Robert Heinlein was writing what he called the "Future History Series." He was writing various stories that fitted into one niche or another of the series, and he wasn't writing them in order. Therefore he had prepared a Future History outline that was very detailed and complicated, so that he would keep everything straight. Now Campbell wanted me to do the same.<br><br>Heinlein, however, was Heinlein &#x2014;and Asimov was not Heinlein.<br><br>I went home dutifully, and began preparing an outline that got longer and longer and stupider and stupider until I finally tore it up. It was quite plain that I couldn't work with an outline. (To this day I cannot &#x2014; for any of my stories, articles, or books, whether fiction or nonfiction.)<br><br>On August 11, therefore, I started the story I had originally intended to write (with modifications that resulted from my discussions with Campbell), and the heck with possible future stories. I'd worry about them when the time came &#x2014; and </i>if<i> the time came.<br><br>Since the First Galactic Empire was breaking down (in my story), certain scientists had set up a Foundation on a world at the rim of the Galaxy, purportedly to prepare a vast encyclopedia of human knowledge, but actually to cut down the period of feudalism and hasten the rise of the Second Empire. I called the story &#x2014; drum roll, please &#x2014; "Foundation." <br><br></i>Later in his autobiography, Asimov notes that he submitted "Foundation" on September 8 and on September 17 received a check for $126. From the on, Foundation stories appeared periodically, if irregularly, until the end of the 1940s. When they were collected, Asimov added one more to form a new introduction, and also changed most of the titles.</p><h2>Boys Over Flowers (Hana Yori Dango), Vol. 2</h2><p>Born into a middle class family and considered poor compared to her wealthy classmates, typical teenager Tsukushi Makino deals with life, love, and new classmates after she is accepted into the prestigious Eitoku academy.</p><p></p><h2>Samurai Cat Goes To Hell</h2><p>Miaowara Tomokato is back--and he's gone to his reward.

Rogers first created the characters in his paintings, and this volume continues the tradition of lavish, attractive illustrationsAmarked, like the story, by both gore and humor. The beginning, as Tomokato and Shiro fight Genghis Khan, is labored (including more than a page of puns on Pax Mongolica), but the story picks up when the heroes go to hell, literally. This comedic Inferno includes Nazi tyrannosaurs in dinosaur-sized tanks, characters resembling figures from the Oz books, Virtuous Pagans galore and Satan, who, though trapped in ice at the bottom of hell, wears pink panties and can send out projections in the shape of bad actors. The heroes are aided by felines from the other Samurai Cat books, a guardian angel named Henry and a mysterious "itinerant preacher" who looks like Clint Eastwood.

So when the Khan explodes a nuke to thwart our heroes, Tomokato and Shiro are blown all to Hell. Even there, they have work to do: Heaven would like Tomokato to kill Satan and wind up the infernal regions for keeps.

It is simultaneously an epic quest across one of the most unusual and brilliantly depicted alien worlds ever conceived, a profoundly moving journey of discovery into the metaphysical heart of the universe, and a shockingly intimate excursion into what makes us human and unique. &nbsp;After a strange interstellar journey, Maskull, a man from Earth, awakens alone in a desert on the planet Tormance, seared by the suns of the binary star Arcturus. As he journeys northward, guided by a drumbeat, he encounters a world and its inhabitants like no other, where gender is a victory won at dear cost; where landscape and emotion are drawn into an accursed dance; where heroes are killed, reborn, and renamed; and where the cosmological lures of Shaping, who may be God, torment Maskull in his astonishing pilgrimage. At the end of his arduous and increasingly mystical quest waits a dark secret and an unforgettable revelation.<i></i>&nbsp;<i>A Voyage to Arcturus</i> was the first novel by writer David Lindsay (1878&#x2013;1945), and it remains one of the most revered classics of science fiction.

Released in 1939, the &#x201c;Big Book,&#x201d; as it&#x2019;s commonly known, has sold an estimated 37 million copies, been translated into seventy languages, and spawned numerous recovery communities around the world while remaining a vibrant plan for recovery from addiction in all its forms for millions of people. While there are many books about A.A. history, most rely on anecdotal stories told well after the fact by Bill Wilson and other early members&#x2015;accounts that have proved to be woefully inaccurate at times. <i>Writing the Big Book</i> brings exhaustive research, academic discipline, and informed insight to the subject not seen since Ernest Kurtz&#x2019;s <i>Not-God</i>, published forty years ago.</p><p>Focusing primarily on the eighteen months from October 1937, when a book was first proposed, and April 1939 when <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> was published, Schaberg&#x2019;s history is based on eleven years of research into the wealth of 1930s documents currently preserved in several A.A. archives. Woven together into an exciting narrative, these real-time documents tell an almost week-by-week story of how the book was created, providing more than a few unexpected turns and surprising departures from the hallowed stories that have been so widely circulated about early A.A. history.</p><p>Fast-paced, engaging, and contrary, <i>Writing the Big Book</i> presents a vivid picture of how early A.A. operated and grew and reveals many previously unreported details about the colorful cast of characters who were responsible for making that group so successful.</p></p><p><p>William H. Schaberg is a scholar and rare book dealer based in Fairfield, Connecticut. His interest in the history of ideas led him to amass a large collection of first edition philosophy texts and inspired his first scholarly work, <i>The Nietzsche Canon: A Publication History and Bibliography</i> (University of Chicago Press, 1995). Schaberg has delivered lectures on Nietzsche, William James, and other philosophers with his mentor King Dykeman at his alma mater, Fairfield University. He has served in the United States Air Force and ran a family printing business for over thirty years before retiring to commit more energy to his bookselling business, Athena Rare Books. Schaberg&#x2019;s scholarly investigation into the authorship of Alcoholics Anonymous was an eleven-year project that, like his Nietzsche book, began with bibliographical confusion over the text&#x2019;s prepublication history and culminated in an unprecedented chronology of the &#x201c;Big Book&#x201d; origins.</p><p>If you have read my husband&#x2019;s book, <i>Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, you may think as I did, that you have a good understanding of that history. And you would be wrong. <i>Writing the Big Book</i> zeroes in on the first five years in a way that no other history of A.A. has captured. And these years were critical. Like a good suspense novel, this book captures the day to day struggles these few intrepid men encountered over those years &#x2013; in the heart of the great depression.... How does a bunch of homeless alcoholics start a worldwide movement? Schaberg&#x2019;s book tells us how they did it, tiny step by tiny step.&#x2015;<b>Linda Farris Kurtz, Professor Emerita, Eastern Michigan University, Author of <i>Recovery Groups</i></b></p><p><i>Writing the Big Book</i> is the most important work on the history of A.A. since Ernie Kurtz&#x2019;s <i>Not-God</i>. Finally, we have a resource that draws upon decades of recent research to separate fact from myth regarding the origin of Alcoholics Anonymous.&#x2015;<b>William L. White, author of <i>Slaying the Dragon</i></b></p><p>This is a book that A.A. historians will want to read and reference from now on . . . the product of incredibly detailed research in the archives at the central A.A. office in New York City and at Stepping Stones in Bedford Hills, New York, along with Lois Wilson&#x2019;s diary, and a host of other primary sources.&#x2015;<b>Glenn F. Chesnut, Emeritus Professor of History, Indiana University South Bend</b></p><p><i>Writing the Big Book</i> details the chapter-by-chapter authoring of Alcoholics Anonymous and provides a revealing anthology of its primary contributors . . . .The revelations about Hank Parkhurst&#x2019;s role in particular cast a welcome and inclusive light on his critical importance, as he is shown to be a true unsung hero.&#x2015;<b>Arthur S., A.A. historian from of Arlington, TX</b></p><p>Schaberg&#x2019;s in-depth research and masterful presentation of previously unpublished facts about A.A.&#x2019;s early history makes for an explosive package . . . Far from presenting a dry historical record, Writing the Big Book is lively, fascinating, compelling, and insightful&#x2015;more like a thriller than a documentary.&#x2015;<b>Jay Stinnett, A.A. historian</b></p><p><i>Writing the Big Book</i> is an invaluable contribution to Alcoholics Anonymous and its membership. Relying on outstanding research and thoroughness, Schaberg shapes a coherent story out of a vast trove of archival material&#x2015;and reveals that the Big Book, far from being simply, divinely inspired, was the work of perfectly flawed human beings, living and striving under great stress and difficulty.&#x2015;<b>Kevin Hanlon, co-creator of the documentary <i>Bill W.</i></b></p><p><i>Writing the Big Book</i> surprises in how well it defines and demonstrates the condition of alcoholism, while so clearly rendering portraits of its interesting cast of characters. I came away with a much better understanding of what some of my dearest friends and family struggle with as alcoholics, along with a deep appreciation for the work that went into the creation of A.A.&#x2015;<b>David Stickney, contributing editor of <i>The Nietzsche Canon</i></b></p><p>For many in recovery, Bill Wilson is a Moses freeing them from the bondage of addiction. As a result, a variety of myths have evolved around him, some encouraged by his own efforts to tell the story and to sell the spiritual program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Bill Schaberg does a great service to the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous with his exhaustive examination of archival documents, separating myth from fact. The result is a clearer picture of the beginnings of A.A. and the development of the Big Book, along with a rich and compelling portrait of Bill W. Less myth produces a much better story. This volume is a must read for any interested in the history of A.A.&#x2015;<b>The Very Rev. Ward B.

The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.<br></p><p><p><strong>James J. Gibson</strong> (1904&#x2013;1979) is one of the most important psychologists of the 20th century, best known for his work on visual perception. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University and his first major work was<em> The</em> <em>Perception of the Visual World</em> (1950) in which he rejected behaviorism for a view based on his own experimental work. </p> <p>In his later works, including <i>The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception</i> (1979), Gibson became more philosophical and criticized cognitivism in the same way he had attacked behaviorism before, arguing strongly in favor of direct perception and direct realism, as opposed to cognitivist indirect realism. He termed his new approach "ecological psychology". </p> <p>Gibson&#x2019;s legacy is increasingly influential on many contemporary movements in psychology, particularly those considered to be post-cognitivist.</p></p><h2>Repase y escriba: Curso avanzado de gramatica y composicin</h2><p>This&nbsp;perennial best-seller is written for Advanced Grammar and Composition or Advanced Composition and Conversation&nbsp;classes.

Continually enmeshed in controversy, perhaps no other figure in the history of world cinema has been so reviled&#x2014;and so revered. Tag Gallagher's masterful biography of Rossellini, the first in any language, was fifteen years in the making. It is the result of assiduous research, lengthy interviews with almost everyone who knew him, and investigations into the making and reception of his films. The cast of characters includes Vittorio Mussolini, Il Duce's son and Rossellini's Fascist-era producer; Howard Hughes, who produced <i>Stromboli</i> and then, in a fit of jealousy over Ingrid Bergman, butchered its American release; and dozens of other people. Combining a portrait of a dynamic and daring man with brilliant discussions of his work, Tag Gallagher tells a story as rich and moving as Rossellini's miraculous films.</p><p><b>Tag Gallagher</b> is the author of the highly acclaimed critical study <i>John Ford: The Man and His Films.</i>Gallagher, the author of John Ford: The Man and His Films, spent 15 years researching and writing this biography of Italian director Roberto Rossellini (1906-1977). In 1945, Rossellini's early film Open City ushered in neorealism, a profoundly influential movement in European filmmaking that eschewed standard Hollywood "entertainments" for something rawer, more naturalistic. A valuable source for film scholars, this book extensively documents the making and critical reception of Rossellini's films, as well as the political and religious turmoil of the era that spawned them. Although Gallagher's extensive film critiques may be more than the general reader really wants, there's also plenty of fascinating personal detail. The filmmaker's tumultuous liaison with actress Anna Magnani is amusingly portrayed, and then there is the infamous affaire Bergman. Rossellini bet a friend he could have the world's most famous actress "in bed within two weeks" after he met her. He evidently won the bet, and scandal ensued when she left her dentist husband to live with Rossellini and to make Stromboli (1949), the first of the commercial and critical disasters that the couple endured before their marriage ended in 1958. Gallagher has combined probing insights into a flamboyant man with a prodigiously researched and footnoted analysis of an iconoclastic filmmaker, whom Francois Truffaut called "the father of the New Wave." 107 illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Clinician&#39;s Thesaurus, 6th Edition: The Guide to Conducting Interviews and Writing Psychological Reports (The Clinician&#39;s Toolbox)</h2><p>Now in a revised and updated sixth edition, this perennially popular resource provides quick and handy access to the entire language of the mental health professions.

Graduate training programs committed to preparing their students for the real work of clinical practice would be wise to make this text mandatory reading."--David Verhaagen, PhD, ABPP, managing partner, Southeast Psychological Services, Charlotte, North Carolina<p>"<i>The Paper Office</i> is a comprehensive, hands-on resource for both the novice and seasoned clinician. The fourth edition incorporates changes in clinical practice, changes in relevant case law and statutes, and updated references to the literature. Zuckerman assists the clinician in developing and maintaining a state-of-the-art clinical practice, including record-keeping procedures that cover everything from each step of the treatment process through the closing of your practice at retirement. I have relied on <i>The Paper Office</i> for years, and will use the ideas in this newest edition to update my current practice!

This indispensable fourth edition is guaranteed to reduce your paperwork blues and make you a more savvy clinician!"--John C. Norcross, PhD, ABPP, Distinguished Professor of Psychology, University of Scranton </p><br><br>"The Paper Office should be among the most well-thumbed works in the library of virtually anyone in independent practice....Thoughtful perusal of and decision-making based on this volume's detailed, inclusive, carefully crafted information should well equip mental health practitioners to establish or update sound and effective practice procedures and materials. Various chapters walk readers through myriad ethical and practical considerations that should underlie the policies and procedures governing their business....Zuckerman's book goes far beyond the nuts and bolts of procedures and record-keeping, however. Much of its value lies in the information and advice it provides on practicing ethically&#x2015;and on thinking through challenging or complex situations and decisions. In the third chapter, the book imparts what is perhaps the most concise and crucial advice, with a list of 22 steps for risk reduction. For these nuggets alone, I believe this work is worth its weight in gold....The Paper Office will provide a lifeline especially for new psychologists when the mountain of knowledge necessary for running a practice looms so large. Veteran practitioners, too, will benefit from Zuckerman's newly revised book, particularly if they wish to review or revise their modus operandi or need help moving from handwritten charts into the electronic record-keeping age. Challenges large and small all seem more manageable with Zuckerman's thorough information, logically organized contents, and the sage know-how that comes from years of experience."

With the permission and blessing of the Asimov estate, the epic saga left unfinished by the Grand Master himself now continues with this second masterful volume.<p> With Hari Seldon on trial for treason, the Galactic Empire's long-anticipated migration to Star's End is about to begin. But the mission's brilliant robot leader, R. Daneel Olivaw, has discovered a potential enemy far deadlier--and closer--than he ever imagined. <em>One of his own kind.</em></p><p> A freak accident erases the basic commandments in humaniform robot Lodovik Trema's positronic brain. Now Lodovic's service to humankind is no longer bound by destiny, but by will. To ensure his loyalty, Daneel has Lodovic secretly reprogrammed. But can he be trusted? Now, other robots are beginning to question their mission--and Daneel's strategy. And stirrings of rebellion, too, are infecting their human counterparts. Among them is a young woman with awesome psychic abilities, a reluctant leader with the power to join man and robot in a quest for common freedom.or mutual destruction.</p><p></p><strong>The Foundation Saga Continues </strong><p> Read Gregory Benford's <em>Foundation's Fear,</em> the first novel in this bold new series and <em>Secret Foundation,</em> the concluding volume from David Brin.</p></p><p>This is book number two in the new Second Foundation Trilogy being written by hard science fiction authors Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, and David Brin, otherwise known as the "Killer B's." In this book, Bear continues where Benford's <i>Foundation's Fear</i> left off, as the trial of legendary psychohistorian Hari Seldon is about to begin. Bear writes with a style uncannily similar to Foundation creator Isaac Asimov's, and he even manages to incorporate some of Asimov's own writing in the novel. Aside from the trial, Bear also focuses on the nearly immortal robots that serve the Foundation, including R. Daneel Olivaw, who is set to guide one of the Foundation's first great undertakings. But Olivaw runs into trouble from an unexpected quarter, his best operative, Lodovik Trema, whose positronic brain has been irrevocably altered in a strange accident that has given him freedom from the supposedly immutable laws of robotics. <i>--Craig Engler</i>Greg Bear has won two Hugo Awards and three Nebula Awards and is a past president to the Science Fiction Writers of America.

They clamor for recognition and respect, sometimes at the expense of other things we value. But to what extent do "identities" constrain our freedom, our ability to make an individual life, and to what extent do they enable our individuality? In this beautifully written work, renowned philosopher and African Studies scholar Kwame Anthony Appiah draws on thinkers through the ages and across the globe to explore such questions.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Ethics of Identity</i> takes seriously both the claims of individuality--the task of making a life---and the claims of identity, these large and often abstract social categories through which we define ourselves.</p><br><p> What sort of life one should lead is a subject that has preoccupied moral and political thinkers from Aristotle to Mill. Here, Appiah develops an account of ethics, in just this venerable sense--but an account that connects moral obligations with collective allegiances, our individuality with our identities. As he observes, the question <i>who</i> we are has always been linked to the question <i>what</i> we are.</p><br><p> Adopting a broadly interdisciplinary perspective, Appiah takes aim at the clich�s and received ideas amid which talk of identity so often founders. Is "culture" a good? For that matter, does the concept of culture really explain anything? Is diversity of value in itself? Are moral obligations the only kind there are? Has the rhetoric of "human rights" been overstretched? In the end, Appiah's arguments make it harder to think of the world as divided between the West and the Rest; between locals and cosmopolitans; between Us and Them. The result is a new vision of liberal humanism--one that can accommodate the vagaries and variety that make us human.</p></p><p><p>"Appiah has written a remarkably impressive book, one that makes a number of important advances on the existing literature and stands as an important contribution to political and moral philosophy and moral psychology. It will be very widely read."<b>--Jacob Levy, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"<i>The Ethics of Identity</i> is a major overhaul of the vocabulary of contemporary political and critical thought--the vocabulary of identity, diversity, authenticity, cosmopolitanism, and culture. The load of hidden assumptions carried by these words had become overwhelming, and someone needed to take them to the shop and give them a thorough philosophical servicing. But Anthony Appiah has done more than that. He has returned those terms to us clarified, refreshed, and ready for use in a more sophisticated and flexible philosophy of Liberalism--and, along the way, he has provided us with a new reading of liberalism's old hero, John Stuart Mill. Appiah's writing is unparalleled in its elegance, its lucidity, and its humanity. Accept no substitutes."<b>--Louis Menand, Harvard University</b></p><p>"In the debates over diversity, rights, group identities or group conflict, <i>The Ethics of Identity</i>, is the land of lucidity. Appiah's elegant book resists the easy alternatives of universal liberalism and multiculturalism and instead defends--and illustrates on every page--a rooted cosmopolitanism. The sparkling prose, vivid examples, and probing questions navigate the choppy waters of personal and political constructions of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and sexuality. This fine and wise book invites readers to remain willing to distinguish tolerance and respect--and by engaging with both the lives people make for themselves and the communities and narratives that render them meaningful."<b>--Martha Minow, Harvard Law School and author of <i>Identity, Politics, and the Law</i></b></p><b>Kwame Anthony Appiah </b>is Laurance S.

They all smile politely, and okay, sure, they&#x2019;re all like twelve, but maybe this is a good sign of the kind of people I&#x2019;ll meet at Gregorstoun. Maybe they won&#x2019;t all be Scary Rich People, but just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. awkward kids.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rich Awkward Kids, but kids all the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> In any case, the road is leveling out now, and the school is suddenly rising up before us, just like the website only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. real.<br> &nbsp;<br> In front of me.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pictures really didn&#x2019;t do it justice. It&#x2019;s all cream-colored stone against the green, rising up four stories, a long gravel drive in front, windows blinking in the sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, wow,&#x201d; I breathe, and Mr. McGregor looks over at me, a twinkle in his eyes if I&#x2019;m not mistaken.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; he agrees. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a sight.&#x201d; Then he sighs, brows drawing together. &#x201c;Used to be my family&#x2019;s home, ya ken, but now I just work here, shuttlin&#x2019; you lot about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m not really sure what to say to that, so I just sort of hum in agreement and turn my attention back to the school.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are a bunch of students milling around on the lawn, some in uniform, some not. I&#x2019;m still wearing my jeans and T-shirt, since my uniform is supposed to be waiting for me in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pulling my backpack into my lap, I take out the email I printed out. Room 327, I read, my fingers moving over the numbers. My room. The room I&#x2019;m going to live in for the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> With another girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s one of the weirder parts of this whole boarding school experiment&#x2014;living with someone else. I was an only child up until eighteen months ago, and I&#x2019;ve never shared a space with someone else like this.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, good practice for college, right?<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. McGregor pulls the car up to the front of the school, where there are already kids heading in, dragging huge roller bags. I have a massive suitcase of my own in the back of the Land Rover (gotten on sale at TJ Maxx, thank you very much), and before I know it, I&#x2019;m standing there in the huge front hall of Gregorstoun, the handle of the bag in my hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s chaos, people weaving in and out, and I look around, trying to take it all in, a mix of nerves and jet lag making me feel more anxious than I&#x2019;d anticipated.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m mostly surprised by how many boys there are. All kinds of boys. Boys who look about twelve, boys who tower over me as they make their way into the house. There must be five boys for every one girl, and I wonder just how many of us applied to be part of Gregorstoun&#x2019;s first female class.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ground floor still looks like someone&#x2019;s house. There are paintings on the wall, little tables full of bric-a-brac, and soft carpets underfoot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ahead of me, a wooden staircase spirals upward, and, swallowing hard, I head toward it, lugging my bag behind me.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are no elevators&#x2014;or lifts, I guess they&#x2019;d call them here&#x2014;so I definitely get my cardio in hauling everything I own up to the third floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a little less chaotic up here, and dimmer. There are fewer windows, and the carpet underfoot feels almost moldy as I creep along it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ew.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I find Room 327 easy enough, and when I open the door, there&#x2019;s no one in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Standing on the threshold, I face two twin beds, one dresser, and a desk on either side of the door. In fact, if you open the door all the way, it hits one of the desks, and for some reason, I decide to go ahead and claim that side of the room. That might endear me to my roommate, right? Picking the crappy side?<br> Pulling my suitcase all the way into the room, I sit on the little bed with its scratchy white sheets and green wool blanket. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve done it. I&#x2019;ve come to Scotland, and I&#x2019;m here for the next year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the enormity of what I&#x2019;ve done can fully sink in, I whip out my phone, pulling up FaceTime to call Dad.<br> &nbsp;<br> He answers almost immediately, and I grin with relief to see him there in the living room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You made it!&#x201d; he enthuses, dark eyes crinkling at the cor-ners, and I nod, spinning my phone around so he can see my room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Living it up in the lap of luxury, obviously,&#x201d; I say, and Anna pops her head in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh my god, it&#x2019;s so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quaint,&#x201d; she says, raising her eye-brows, and I wave at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If quaint means a little creepy and small, then yes!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She frowns slightly, leaning closer to Dad&#x2019;s phone. &#x201c;Millie, if this isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; she starts to say, but then the door to my room flies open again, thumping hard against my desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; a voice insists. &#x201c;This is not what was agreed to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A girl steps into the room followed by a man in a dark suit, and just for a second, my family and my phone are totally for-gotten.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not cool to stare, I know that, but this is literally the prettiest girl I&#x2019;ve ever seen in my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;s taller than I am, and her hair is gold. Like. Literally gold, like dark honey. It&#x2019;s held back from her face with a thin headband, and that face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> &nbsp;<br> I realize while looking at her that beauty is more than just the way your face is structured, the weird quirks of DNA and societal norms that make us say, &#x201c;This nose is the best nose,&#x201d; or &#x201c;This is why I like this mouth,&#x201d; or whatever. This girl has clearly won a genetic lottery, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, but it&#x2019;s not just that&#x2014;it&#x2019;s that she seems to glow. Her skin is so smooth and luminous I want to stroke her face like some kind of weirdo. I&#x2019;m not sure she would even know what the word &#x201c;pore&#x201d; means. Does she follow one of those intense ten-step skin routines? Has she found magical sheet masks made of pearls?<br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe this is just what being rich does to your face. Because there&#x2019;s no doubt this girl is also very, very rich. Her clothes are simple&#x2014;a sweater and jeans tucked into high leather boots&#x2014;but they practically smell like money. She smells like money.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also, only rich people can curl their lips the way she&#x2019;s currently doing at the guy in the suit who followed her in. Her dad? He looks a little young, plus it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that a guy with heavy jowls and pockmarked skin could possibly be related to this actual angel of a girl, standing there with a Louis Vuitton bag in the crook of her elbow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your mother&#x2014;&#x201d; the man starts, and she throws up her hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call her, then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; the man asks, his heavy brow wrinkling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother,&#x201d; she repeats, her voice carrying just the softest Scottish burr. Her chin is lifted, and I can actually feel tension vibrating off her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We were told&#x2014;&#x201d; the man says on a sigh, but she&#x2019;s not giving in. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On my phone, Dad scowls. &#x201c;Everything okay?&#x201d; he asks, and I glance back at my new roommate, still imperiously repeating, &#x201c;Call my mother,&#x201d; every time the man tries to speak. And now I realize he&#x2019;s pulled his phone out, I assume to call her mother, and she&#x2019;s still saying it, over and over again, like a toddler.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call my mother. Call my mother. Call. My. Mother.&#x201d; Maybe it&#x2019;s jet lag. Maybe it&#x2019;s the weird, weightless feeling in my stomach that started the moment I walked into the school and just what a massive change I&#x2019;d made fully sunk in.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I turn to look over at her, and before I can think better of it, I hear myself say, &#x201c;Hey. Veruca Salt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips part slightly, eyebrows going up as she stares at me. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve never wanted to pull words back into my mouth so badly. Lee was right about me not liking confrontation&#x2014;it&#x2019;s pretty much my least favorite thing, right there underneath mayonnaise and jazz music. But something about how this girl is talking just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bugged me.<br> &nbsp;<br> So maybe this is who I am now? Millie Quint, Confronter of People.<br> &nbsp;<br> I decide to keep going with it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you mind being a little quieter?&#x201d; I waggle my phone at her. &#x201c;Some of us are trying to talk, and it seems like my dude here is calling your mom, so, like, maybe take it down a thou-sand notches?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She keeps staring at me, and the man with her is now looking at me, too, his florid face going even redder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever. I take a deep breath and turn back to Dad. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m here, I&#x2019;m safe, everything is great&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ish, and I&#x2019;ll call you back later, okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rubbing his eyes, Dad nods. &#x201c;Sounds good, Mils. Love you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Love you, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He hangs up, and I go back to the suitcase on my bed. I still have a ton of unpacking to do, and it&#x2019;s going to take a lot of work to get this room looking even the littlest bit homey, so I should&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you really call me Veruca Salt?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I turn around to see my new roommate standing there with her arms folded. The guy who was with her is out in the hall, talking on his cell phone, probably to this girl&#x2019;s mom like she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I take a second to study her now that I&#x2019;m not blinded by her bone structure and shiny hair. Her sweater is a pale green that would make anyone else look vaguely ill, but just plays up the gold in her eyes, and yeah, my original take of her being the prettiest girl I&#x2019;ve ever seen holds up, but the sulky way her mouth is turning down kills a little bit of her glow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I did, yeah,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;It seemed like you were about three seconds from launching into a musical number about wanting things, so it just felt right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lips purse together, curling up into a smile. &#x201c;Charming,&#x201d; she finally says, then her eyes drop to my jeans&#x2014;nowhere near as nice as hers&#x2014;and my long-sleeved T-shirt. It&#x2019;s the one I got working on the yearbook last year. I&#x2019;d figured there was no sense in dressing up, since we&#x2019;d get our uniforms as soon as we came, but now, next to this girl, I feel a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grubby.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I take it you&#x2019;re my roommate,&#x201d; she says, and I cross my own arms, mimicking her posture.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So it seems.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That smile again. It&#x2019;s a straight-up Disney villain smile, reminding me that no matter how gorgeous this girl is, she&#x2019;s clearly a witch.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a delight for us both,&#x201d; she says, and then she turns, flouncing back out of the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;s probably running to the headmaster to ask to be moved or something, and frankly, that suits me just fine.<br> &nbsp;<br> But hey, maybe school is going to keep us both so busy that I&#x2019;ll hardly even have to see her.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s only after I&#x2019;ve heard her stomping footsteps disappear down the hall that I realize I never learned her name.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 8:</b><br><br> According to the itinerary I was emailed, I have a &#x201c;tea&#x201d; at 4 p.m., and since it&#x2019;s 3 now, I change into my new uniform, which was hanging up in the closet, draped with plastic, when I arrived. There&#x2019;s a knee-length plaid skirt, a short-sleeved white shirt, and two different sweaters, one long-sleeved, the other a vest. I choose that one, the Gregorstoun crest stitched on the front. It&#x2019;s warm enough so I don&#x2019;t have to bother with the dark tights, settling on the kneesocks instead and finally sliding my feet into a pair of very plain black flats.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s a mirror affixed to the back of the door, and I take a moment to look at myself, this new Millie. A Gregorstoun Girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> Same boring brown hair curling over my shoulders, same brown eyes. Same dimples, as I see when I give a forced smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> Same Millie, different place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sighing, I open the door and step out into the hall, only to immediately hear someone calling out.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Perry, she&#x2019;s on this floor!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice around the corner is clearly coming from a Disney Princess&#x2014;sweet, melodious, complete with the perfect cut-glass English accent, and I expect the girl I&#x2019;m about to see will look like a cross between Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. There might even be woodland creatures trailing in her wake.<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl who suddenly appears is beautiful, and she&#x2019;s also&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a giant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, that&#x2019;s not really fair, but she is easily over six feet tall, although when I glance down, I see she&#x2019;s wearing high-heeled boots. And while she might not look like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, she is beautiful, with long dark hair and smooth brown skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> And when looks down at me, I see she has lovely brown eyes that crinkle at the corners as she smiles. &#x201c;Oh, hullo!&#x201d; she says brightly. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even see you there!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s probably because I&#x2019;m basically a squirrel while she&#x2019;s a giraffe, and I give an awkward wave. &#x201c;I tend to blend in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re American!&#x201d; she trills, then gestures behind her impatiently. &#x201c;LOOK, PERRY, I&#x2019;VE FOUND AN AMERICAN!&#x201d; she calls, loud enough to...</p><h2>Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology: A Resource Manual (includes Premium Web Site 2-Semester Printed Access Card)</h2><p>This trusted, best-selling text has become an essential, invaluable resource for clinicians, instructors, and students in the dynamic field of speech-language pathology.

The pieces probably date from 1786 or 1787, around the time that Jane, aged 11 or 12, and her older sister and collaborator Cassandra left school. By this point Austen was already an indiscriminate and precocious reader, devouring pulp fiction and classic literature alike; what she read, she soon began to imitate and parody. <br><br>Unlike many teenage writings then and now, these are not secret or agonized confessions entrusted to a private journal and for the writer's eyes alone. Rather, they are stories to be shared and admired by a named audience of family and friends. Devices and themes which appear subtly in Austen's later fiction run riot openly and exuberantly across the teenage page. Drunkenness, brawling, sexual misbehavior, theft, and even murder prevail. It is as if Lydia Bennett is the narrator.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kathryn Sutherland</strong> is the editor of Austen-Leigh's <em>Memoir of Jane Austen: and Other Family Recollections</em> for Oxford World's Classics.

From a previously unpublished 1917 script featuring Ernest Bramah&#x2019;s blind detective Max Carrados, to early 1950s crime stories written for London&#x2019;s Evening Standard by Cyril Hare, Freeman Wills Crofts and A.A. Milne, it spans five decades of writing by masters of the Golden Age.</p><p>Most anticipated of all are the contributions by women writers: the first detective story by Georgette Heyer, unseen since 1923; an unpublished story by Christianna Brand, creator of Nanny McPhee; and a dark tale by Agatha Christie published only in an Australian journal in 1922 during her &#x2018;Grand Tour&#x2019; of the British Empire.</p><p>With other stories by Detection Club stalwarts Anthony Berkeley, H.C. Bailey, J.J. Connington, John Rhode and Nicholas Blake, plus Vincent Cornier, Leo Bruce, Roy Vickers and Arthur Upfield, this essential collection harks back to a time before forensic science &#x2013; when murder was a complex business.</p></p><p><p>Editor Tony Medawar is a detective fiction expert and researcher with a penchant for tracking down rare stories. His other collections of previously uncollected stories include WHILE THE LIGHT LASTS (Agatha Christie), THE AVENGING CHANCE (Anthony Berkeley), THE SPOTTED CAT (Christianna Brand) and A SPOT OF FOLLY (Ruth Rendell).</p><p>&#x2018;A veritable treasure trove of classic short stories.

Thomas Mathews explores the many different, often surprising, artistic images and religious interpretations of Christ during this period. He challenges the accepted theory of the "Emperor Mystique," which, interpreting Christ as king, derives the vocabulary of Christian art from the propagandistic imagery of the Roman emperor. This revised edition contains a new preface by the author and a new chapter on the origin and development of icons in private domestic cult.</p></p><p><p>"This book presents an up-to-date and original survey of Early Christian art and its origins, and attacks the current idea of continuity between the Roman emperor cult and the art of the early church. Conservative readers may well be shocked by this lucid but utterly unconventional presentation of an often treated subject. I find Thomas Mathews's work convincing and impressive."<b>--Hugo Buchthal</b></p><p>"Not only does Mathews present bold arguments that I find persuasive, but his book is exciting to read. He removes the images of Christ from the iconography of the emperor and puts them into the far more plausible context of late antique teachers and wonder-workers."<b>--G. W.

Broken into many short sections and peppered with Epstein&#x2019;s own playful hand-drawn illustrations, the book does not simply give the right answer: It also goes into the answers that seem right but are wrong and shows why they are wrong a rarity in science books. <i>Thinking Physics</i> is a rigorously correct, lighthearted, and cleverly designed Q and A book for physicists of all ages.</p><p>Epstein is a physics and astronomy professor.<br><br>Epstein is a physics and astronomy professor.</p><h2>Best of Costume Jewelry</h2><p>Beautiful costume jewelry reference guide by Nancy Schiffer.

"The most compelling account yet of how . . . hallucinogenic, or 'psychedelic,' drugs became an explosive force in postwar American history."--<i>Newsweek</i>Stevens has written a gripping account of the use and abuse of mind-altering drugs in recent decades. He explains the fascination of mescaline and psilocybin for psychologists interested in behaviorial change. He documents the insidious role of the CIA in testing mind-control drugs. He traces the convoluted path of Timothy Leary from his position as research psychologist at Harvard to his role as guru advocating the use of LSD to achieve spiritual utopia. He descibes the outwardly placid social climate of the 1950s, and vividly contrasts the dramatic upheavals of the 60s, sketching pulsing portraits of Allen Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, and Jack Kerouac.

Here is a fresh translation from Sherab Ch�dzin Kohn, a gifted translator and longtime student of Buddhism and Eastern philosophy. Kohn's flowing, poetic translation conveys the philosophical and spiritual nuances of Hesse's text, paying special attention to the qualities of meditation experience. This edition also includes an introduction exploring Hesse's own spiritual journey as evidenced in his journals and personal letters.</p><p>In the shade of a banyan tree, a grizzled ferryman sits listening to the river. Some say he's a sage. He was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But this man, Siddhartha, was not a follower of any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence, and charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a life of pleasure and titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other "child people," dragged around by his desires. Like Hermann Hesse's other creations of struggling young men, <i>Siddhartha</i> has a good dose of European angst and stubborn individualism. His final epiphany challenges both the Buddhist and the Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river. In this translation Sherab Chodzin Kohn captures the slow, spare lyricism of Siddhartha's search, putting her version on par with Hilda Rosner's standard edition. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam.

From the forefront of CMOS technology, Phil and Doug have combined their expertise as engineers and academics to present a cutting-edge and effective overview of the principles and techniques for designing circuits. Their two main goals are:<br> <br> � to mix the academic and practical viewpoints in a treatment that is neither superficial nor overly detailed and<br> � to teach analog integrated circuit design with a hierarchically organized approach.<br> <br> Most of the techniques and principles presented in the second edition have been taught over the last ten years to industry members. Their needs and questions have greatly shaped the revision process, making this new edition a valuable resource for practicing engineers.<br> <br> The trademark approach of Phil and Doug's textbook is its design recipes, which take readers step-by-step through the creation of real circuits, explaining complex design problems. The book provides detailed coverage of often-neglected areas and deliberately leaves out bipolar analog circuits, since CMOS is the dominant technology for analog integrated circuit design. Appropriate for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with background knowledge in basic electronics including biasing, modeling, circuit analysis, and frequency response, <em>CMOS Analog Circuit Design, Second Edition</em>, presents a complete picture of design (including modeling, simulation, and testing) and enables readers to design an analog circuit that can be implemented by CMOS technology.<br> <br> <strong>Features</strong><br> � Orients the experience of the expert within the perspective of design methodology<br> � Identifies common mistakes made by beginning designers<br> � Provides problems with each chapter that reinforce and develop student understanding<br> � Contains numerous problems that can be used as homework, quiz, or exam problems<br> � Includes a new section on switched-capacitor circuits<br> � Includes helpful appendices that provide simulation techniques and the following supplemental material:<br> A brief review of circuit analysis for CMOS analog design<br> A calculator program for analyzing CMOS circuits<br> A summary of time-frequency domain relationships for second-order systems</p><p>Phillip E.

It is our classic tale of growing up, an enchanting story of a gently orphan discovering life and love in an indifferent adult world. Persecuted by his wrathful stepfather, Mr. Murdstone; deceived by his boyhood idol, the callous, charming Steerforth; driven into mortal combat with the sniveling clerk Uriah Heep; and hurled, pell-mell, into a blizzard of infatuation with the adorably dim-witted Dora, he survives the worst&#x2014;and the best&#x2014;with inimitable style, his bafflement tuming to self-awareness and his unbridles young heart growing ever more disciplined and true.<br><br>Of this richly autobiographical novel Dickens himself wrote, "like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favorite child. And his name is David Copperfield."</p><p><p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p>Charles Dickens was born in a little house in Landport, Portsea, England, on February 7, 1812. The second of eight children, he grew up in a family frequently beset by financial insecurity. At age eleven, Dickens was taken out of school and sent to work in London backing warehouse, where his job was to paste labels on bottles for six shillings a week. His father John Dickens, was a warmhearted but improvident man. When he was condemned the Marshela Prison for unpaid debts, he unwisely agreed that Charles should stay in lodgings and continue working while the rest of the family joined him in jail. This three-month separation caused Charles much pain; his experiences as a child alone in a huge city&#x2013;cold, isolated with barely enough to eat&#x2013;haunted him for the rest of his life.<br><br>When the family fortunes improved, Charles went back to school, after which he became an office boy, a freelance reporter and finally an author. With <b>Pickwick Papers </b>(1836-7) he achieved immediate fame; in a few years he was easily the post popular and respected writer of his time. It has been estimated that one out of every ten persons in Victorian England was a Dickens reader. <b>Oliver Twist </b>(1837), <i>Nicholas Nickleby </i>(1838-9) and <i>The Old Curiosity Shop </i>(1840-41) were huge successes. <i>Martin Chuzzlewit </i>(1843-4) was less so, but Dickens followed it with his unforgettable, <b>A Christmas Carol</b><i> </i>(1843), <b>Bleak House</b><i> </i>(1852-3), <b>Hard Times </b>(1854) and<i> Little Dorrit </i>(1855-7)<i> </i>reveal his deepening concern for the injustices of British Society. <b> A Tale of Two Cities</b><i> </i>(1859), <b>Great Expectations </b>(1860-1) and <i>Our Mutual Friend </i>(1864-5) complete his major works.<br><br>Dickens&#x2019;s marriage to Catherine Hoggarth produced ten children but ended in separation in 1858. In that year he began a series of exhausting public readings; his health gradually declined. After putting in a full day&#x2019;s work at his home at Gads Hill, Kent on June 8, 1870, Dickens suffered a stroke, and he died the following day.</p><h2>America&#39;s History: Concise Edition, Volume 1</h2><p><p>Watch our diverse history come alive through the images, maps, and primary sources shared in <em>America's History, Concise Edition, Volume 1</em>. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance (Mathematics, Finance and Risk, Series Number 1)</h2><p>This introductory text provides a clear understanding of the intuition behind derivatives pricing, how models are implemented, and how they are used and adapted in practice.

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the <em>Tractatus</em> and to illuminate its more neglected aspects.<br>David Pears and Brian McGuinness revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments in his correspondence with C.K. Ogden about the first translation. In addition, this edition contains the introduction by Bertrand Russell which appeared in the original English translation.</p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951) is regarded by many as the most outstanding philosopher of the twentieth century.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Drugs &amp; Behavior (7th Edition)</h2><p><p>-</p> <p> <b> <i>An up-to-date overview of behavioral pharmacology.</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Drugs &amp; Behavior</i> starts with descriptions of basic pharmacological concepts of drug administration and pharmacokinetics, research methodology including clinical trials, tolerance and withdrawal, drug conditioning, addiction processes, and the neuroscience of drug action.&nbsp;Each chapter applies these concepts to different classes of recreational and therapeutic drugs. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Each chapter also includes a section on the history of the drug class being described to place the drugs in their historical and social context.

Autism as Context Blindness provides a unique glance into the minds of individuals with ASD. Mom&#39;s Choice Award Winner Dr. Vermeulen has produced a brilliant work that demands attention. Autism as Context Blindness provides a unique glance into the minds of individuals with ASD. It is simple but groundbreaking. Application of Vermeulen&#39;s insights into the mind of autism will help individuals with ASD to become ready for the contexts in which they live. While we have become increasingly familiar with the term autistic thinking, people with autism are still misunderstood. In this book, inspired by the ideas of Uta Frith, the internationally known psychologist and a pioneer in theory of mind as it relates to autism, Vermeulen explains in everyday terms how the autistic brain functions and highlights the impact of not understanding context. Full of often humorous examples, the book examines context as it relates to observation, social interactions, communication and knowledge. The book concludes with a section on how to reduce context blindness - a skill vital for successful functioning. Due to the far-reaching consequences of context blindness, this book is a must-read for those living and working with somebody with autism. Dr. Vermeulen&#39;s insights regarding context blindness deliver fresh perspective on how individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) perceive and respond to their environment.</p><p>Dr. Vermeulen is a psychologist and Co-director of the Centre for Concrete Communication, a training and education center specializing in Autism Spectrum Disorders in Belgium. Dr. Vermeulen s insights regarding context blindness deliver fresh perspective on how individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) perceive and respond to their environment.Peter Vermeulen brings a truly refreshing perspective to autism and thus sheds new light on our still blurry vision of this perennially fascinating condition. His wonderfully embracing concept of 'context blindness' provides a powerful explanation of the varied features of autism spectrum disorders. --Uta Firth, world expert on autism, developmental psychologist and professor, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Dept. of Psychology, University College, London<br><br>While Peter Vermeulen demonstrates a strong scientific base for his elaborate discussion on context blindness, it is his folksy manner and pragmatic thinking that makes this book such a wonderful teaching tool for any of us interested in studying factors that contribute to the social learning and problem-solving challenges we observe in our students, clients, and/or children. As Vermeulen guides us to explore different aspects of context blindness, he also encourages us to create treatment strategies to help all of us better inform and guide our children/students with regard to the many and varied issues that result from struggling to perceive all that is. This book is highly recommended for parents, counselors, and teachers to help us all learn to avoid our own blindness to what is causing our students to react and respond the way they do. --Michelle Garcia Winner, speech-language pathologist, MA-CCC, founder of Social Thinking. author of THINKING ABOUT YOU THINKING ABOUT ME<br><br>With this impressive body of work, Dr. Peter Vermeulen connects what scientists have learned about what is happening in the brains of individuals with autism to what parents and teachers need to know to teach and support effectively. This amazing book explores the complexity of social competence through an extensive review of the various autism learning theories and research that both supports and questions those ideas. Vermeulen presents this essential information in a clear and accessible way, making this book essential reading for anyone charged with educating a person on the spectrum. One of my favorite quotes in the book is, 'There is a lot of know-how about autism, but there is little know-why.' This does a knock-out job of helping us understand the whys. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever been confused by the behavior of a child or student with autism. --Kari Dunn Buron, MS, educator, autism education specialist, and author of A 5 IS AGAINST THE LAW</p><h2>New Testament Words (The William Barclay Library)</h2><p><p>Greek is one of the richest of all languages, with an unrivaled power to express different shades of meaning.

As one of the world's most widely read interpreters of the Bible and its meaning, William Barclay devoted his life to helping people become more faithful disciples of Jesus Christ.</p></p><p><b>William Barclay</b> (1907-1978) is known and loved by millions worldwide as one of the greatest Christian teachers of modern times.

His most popular work, the <i>Daily Study Bible</i>, has been translated into over a dozen languages and has sold more than ten million copies around the world.&#39;I should like to think of this book as an attempt to make the results of linguistic scholarship available for the ordinary reader of the New Testament.

The memoir documents not only his own personal experience, as a patriotic young officer, of the horrors and disillusionment of battle, but also the wider loss of innocence the Great War brought about. By the time of his writing, a way of life had ended, and England and the modern world would never be the same. In Graves's portrayal of the dehumanizing misery of the trenches, his grief over lost friends, and the surreal absurdity of government bureaucracy, Graves uses broad comedy to make the most serious points about life and death.</p><p>The quintessential memoir of the generation of Englishmen who suffered in World War I is among the bitterest autobiographies ever written. Robert Graves's stripped-to-the-bone prose seethes with contempt for his class, his country, his military superiors, and the civilians who mindlessly cheered the carnage from the safety of home. His portrait of the stupidity and petty cruelties endemic in England's elite schools is almost as scathing as his depiction of trench warfare. Nothing could equal Graves's bone-chilling litany of meaningless death, horrific encounters with gruesomely decaying corpses, and even more appalling confrontations with the callousness and arrogance of the military command. Yet this scarifying book is consistently enthralling. Graves is a superb storyteller, and there's clearly something liberating about burning all your bridges at 34 (his age when <i>Good-Bye to All That</i> was first published in 1929). He conveys that feeling of exhilaration to his readers in a pell-mell rush of words that remains supremely lucid. Better known as a poet, historical novelist, and critic, Graves in this one work seems more like an English Hemingway, paring his prose to the minimum and eschewing all editorializing because it would bring him down to the level of the phrase- and war-mongers he despises. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>English novelist, poet, and essayist Graves, author of <i>I, Claudius</i> describes the break he made with his past in 1929. In chronicling his youth, World War I experiences, and years at Oxford, Graves gives parallel accounts of the end of his own innocence and that of the world prior to the Great War.</p><h2>Orbital Mechanics: For Engineering Students (Aerospace Engineering)</h2><p>Orbital mechanics is a cornerstone subject for aerospace engineering students.

At the end of the day, it&#x2019;s all about the presence of God and His purposes in our lives. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m so happy about this book, Shifting Atmospheres. Author Dawna De Silva does a great job of instructing us how to change the atmosphere in any situation. She is a trusted voice in our environment here at Bethel Church. She speaks and writes with great authority and insight because this is how she lives.

Her new book, Shifting Atmospheres, sheds light on the spiritual realm in a way that is clear and easy to understand. I believe that the revelation in this book will dispel any fear that you may have when approaching the mysteries of the unseen realm. Using Jesus as the ultimate role model and biblical foundation of truth, Dawna will empower you to take authority over spiritual atmospheres through discernment, gaining insight, and using Kingdom weapons like peace, joy, and worship. I highly recommend this book to anyone who operates in the gift of discernment and wants to live an empowered, victorious, and free life! <br><br> KRIS VALLOTTON<br> Leader, Bethel Church, Redding, CA Co-founder of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry Author of eleven books including The Supernatural Ways of Royalty and Spirit Wars<br><br> There is a very real spirit world all around us. Just beyond the veil of what we can see with natural eyes, there is a realm that&#x2019;s even more real than what we can experience with our senses. <br> We as Christians should not be ignorant of this realm. It&#x2019;s a realm where angels and demons dwell, and this realm lives among us. For many believers, this world of the spirit remains invisible to the natural senses. Some are given opportunities to catch glimpses of how this unseen realm operates. For most, it remains invisible, but just because it&#x2019;s invisible doesn&#x2019;t mean it doesn&#x2019;t have influence and impact. <br> I believe the Lord is raising up voices that remind the Body of Christ that this spiritual realm is very real, very present among us, and a very real source of conflict. And yet, these voices don&#x2019;t just point to the activities of darkness&#x2014;they provide strategies for how you and I, people filled with the Holy Spirit, can and should establish the spiritual atmospheres around us. <br> Dawna De Silva understands much about this realm. In her book Shifting Atmospheres, she does an excellent job of breaking it down and giving us behind-the-scenes understanding into this realm. She explains how we can operate in victorious spiritual warfare and stand in our God-given right to take authority over the spiritual atmospheres for our families, homes, and cities. <br><br> BENI JOHNSON<br> Bethel Church<br> Best-selling author of The Happy Intercessor, Healthy and Free, and 40 Days to Wholeness<br><br> There is a current flurry of activity in the ministries of deliverance and inner healing that arguably has not been seen since the Jesus Movement of the 1970s. I believe the Lord is bringing this ministry back to the forefront. <br> Hosea 4:6 says that people perish or are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The church has been wandering in the wilderness in this area of ministry for much too long. It&#x2019;s time to see God&#x2019;s people set free. <br> Dawna&#x2019;s new book unpacks the weapons of our warfare, which are indeed mighty in God for pulling down strongholds. She does it in a simple and realistic way. <br> Be informed and be equipped. I highly recommend this work. <br><br> DR. WILLIAM (BILL) SUDDUTH<br> President, International Society of Deliverance Ministers<br><br> In her book Shifting Atmospheres, Dawna De Silva provides refreshing insight into the realms and dimensions of the spirit while equipping the reader to conquer the attacks of the enemy. Just when I thought there was not another creative way to write about spiritual warfare, Dawna surprised me and beautifully articulated Kingdom truths on this vital subject. I am passionate about the education of believers in the area of spiritual warfare and personal freedom; that is why I am excited about this book! <br><br> RYAN LESTRANGE<br> Founder, Tribe Network/Ryan LeStrange Ministries Author, Overcoming Spiritual Attack and Supernatural Access<br><br> I just read Dawna De Silva&#x2019;s new book, Shifting Atmospheres, and I have one word that can describe it&#x2014;balanced! It takes on one of the toughest subjects and injects some spiritual intelligence as well as some well-thought-out reworking of some very touchy subjects. If we are going to shift atmospheres in culture, we have to have tools like this to give us a modern understanding while not sacrificing the power of the Gospel. This book will be quoted by many in the future and has set a new benchmark in our focus on both the strategy of the enemy but ultimately our focus on Jesus and His Kingdom that never ends. <br><br> SHAWN BOLZ<br> TV Host and author of God Secrets, Translating God, and Keys to Heaven&#x2019;s Economy www.bolzministries.com<br> At a time when many wear rose-colored glasses and pretend that the devil doesn&#x2019;t exist, Dawna De Silva gives a refreshing reminder: True victory isn&#x2019;t in the denial of evil, but it&#x2019;s in the defeat of evil. In Shifting Atmospheres, she carefully uncovers the realities of our enemy and his tactics. But she doesn&#x2019;t dwell there. Instead, Dawna passionately focuses on Christ and reveals step by step how to activate an atmosphere of His power over yourself, your home, and your region. Truly, Shifting Atmospheres is a profound resource that moves you from the trappings of fighting a devil who&#x2019;s defeated to living in the victory of the One who defeated him. <br><br> KYLE WINKLER<br> Author of Activating the Power of God&#x2019;s Word and creator of the Shut Up, Devil! app www.kylewinkler.org<br><br> Dawna De Silva has written a book that is necessary for all in the Body of Christ. Shifting Atmospheres is a unique, excellent resource to help every believer understand how to activate faith to impact the environments around them. Faith is believing when not seeing. Faith works in time and space. Dawna has an incredible ability to capture how to see into your time and space to discern your atmosphere and to see what you can&#x2019;t see. I believe this book will break the &#x201c;Thomas Syndrome&#x201d; off the Body of Christ. Thomas had to see to believe. Shifting Atmospheres explains how to see the invisible around you.

Often, we sense with our spirits what we don&#x2019;t see with our eyes, and we can shift it with Spirit-led words in the name of Jesus and spiritual weapons like peace, home, and worship. <br> In Shifting Atmospheres, Dawna De Silva teaches us how to discern spiritual atmospheres everywhere we go so we can release the Kingdom and dispel powers of darkness for God&#x2019;s glory. With scriptural backing and practical examples, Dawna inspires us to partner with Holy Spirit to boldly take authority over demon powers that defy the will of God in our lives, our homes, and our cities.

No matter how much you know, there are still a couple of tricks that even the oldest angler can pick up. <p>For those of you who have never fished, you will find enough in this book to get you started.

Why do we get embarrassed, and why does embarrassment make us blush? Why do we frown when we're disappointed? These any many other questions about the emotional life of humans and animals are answered in this remarkable book.<br> <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em> was an immediate best-seller when it was first published in 1872 and still provides the point of departure for research into emotion and facial expression. In his study of infants and children (including delightful observations of his own baby's smiles and pouts), of the insane, of painting and sculpture, of cats and dogs and monkeys, and of the ways that people in different cultures express their feelings, Darwin's insights have not been surpassed by modern science. This definitive edition contains a substantial new Introduction and Afterword by Paul Ekman. Ekman also provides commentaries that use the latest scientific knowledge to elaborate, support, and occasionally challenge Darwin's study. When it originally appeared, this was the first scientific book to contain photographic reproductions. For this edition, Ekman has returned to Darwin's original notes in order to produce, for the first time, a corrected, authoritative text illustrated by drawings and photographs positioned exactly as its author intended.<br> <em>The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals</em> reminds us that, in addition to being the nineteenth century's most influential thinker, Darwin was also a writer of consummate skill. Beautifully and profusely illustrated, and filled with insights that immediately ring true, this new edition promises to delight and enthrall a new generation of readers.</p><p>&#34;Even cows, when they frisk about from pleasure, throw up their tails in a ridiculous fashion.&#34; So writes Charles Darwin in his magnum opus on how humans and animals display such emotions as fear, anger, disdain, and pleasure; it is work that has in most respects been sustained by later scientific research. First published in 1872, Darwin&#39;s greatest work was never issued in quite the shape its author intended: bits and pieces were left out of subsequent printings, most of them released after Darwin&#39;s death, and later editors made additions to suit the intellectual fashion of their times. This definitive edition, heavily annotated, brings us the book that Darwin would have wanted, and it is essential to any naturalist&#39;s library.A study of the muscular movements of the face (both human and animal) triggered by the emotions being felt - a &#39;physical&#39; response to a &#39;mental&#39; sensation. Darwin&#39;s detailed analysis of what actually happens to the body in a state of fear, or joy, or anger is illustrated by photographic images.</p><h2>Branch Point</h2><p>A time traveler who started out from the year 2062 chronicles four alternate histories of Earth, in which she and her companions save the world from nuclear war in the 1960s before becoming trapped in the 1830s.

The book also offers the first detailed account of how the world of scholarship became aware of the existence of prehistoric art, reproducing the very earliest drawings by explorers and surveyors from the 1600s onward to create a unique pictorial as well as discursive resource. With this powerful combination of illustration and analysis, Paul Bahn describes what prehistoric art is and the different ways in which it can shed light on the lives and preoccupations of our ancestors: sexual, humorous, social, economic, and religious. The result is a fascinating exploration: a book that Desmond Morris describes as &#34;a model of scientific restraint and objectivity....this is ultimately an art book, and as such it is endlessly provocative and engaging.&#34; Paul Bahn is an archaeologist and the author of more than 400 publications. He has authored or coauthored eight books, including The Cambridge Illustrated History of Archaeology. Dr. Bahn is a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.</p><p>"When I first visited the painted cave at Lascaux, not long after it had been discovered, I was stunned by what I saw. The skill of the prehistoric artists and the beauty of the images on the walls overwhelmed me. A companion, staring at them open-mouthed, blurted out that they must be fakes--they were clearly too good to have been produced by a Stone Age tribe. Of course, she was wrong. Much research has taken place during the half century since Lascaux was revealed to the world, and we now know that these remarkable paintings are perfectly genuine. My companion's disbelief was an impulsive reaction to the sheer quality of the portrayals. Therein lies their mystery and their greatest fascination." From the foreword by Desmond Morris<br><br>"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art presents the first balanced and truly worldwide survey of prehistoric art....a fascinating exploration of prehistoric art that is informative, engaging, and beautifully presented." Reviewer's Bookwatch<br><br>"....an effective visual introduction with a technical bibliograohy to guide serious students." Booklist<br><br>"Bahn...has written what must be considered the most comprehensive treatise on prehistoric art to date. The writing is lucid and descriptive, satisfying to the advanced anthropologist or artist while quite comprehensible to uninitiated readers. Highly recommended for all levels." Choice<br><br>"Using his expertise and experience as an archaeologist, the author has put together a fascinating study of Prehistoric Art. This fascinating book is highly readable, attractively formatted and would be of great value in an art history class with a range broad enough to cover prehistory." Rita N. Doyle, Book Report<br><br>"Bahn has authored a book that will be useful to nonspecialist professionals and students with interests in the fascinating subject of parietal art." Thomas F. Aleto, American AntiquityPrehistoric artwork is puzzling to modern archaeologists, for its creators are long gone and their purposes obscure. Bahn surveys the field, spanning the continents, from a historical perspective, as he did the broader subject of archaeology in <i>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Archaeology</i> (1996); that is, he recounts how antiquarian approaches of the nineteenth century--just collecting the stuff--gave way to scientific methods of interpretation. For cave paintings and portable objects, such as "Venus" figurines, dating has become very accurate, thanks to stratigraphic and radiocarbon analysis (and helpful in exposing fakes, as one sidebar explains). But rock carvings tend to remain as obstinately undatable as they are ubiquitous; whatever their exact ages, their meanings excite speculation, capitalized on through this volume's wealth of photographs accompanied by informative captions. Bahn's final chapter warns of threats to petroglyphs because of their popularity, capping an effective visual introduction with a technical bibliography to guide serious students. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>United States History: Power Basics (Student Text)</h2><p>Providing high-caliber content at a simple reading level, this fully developed curriculum is particularly apt for differentiated classrooms and ELL and ESL students.

A pompous Under-Secretary of State, an exploitative and acquisitive American and her unhappy "niece," a shady radical peer, and a brutal aristocrat are only some of the characters in this, one of Trollope's most engaging novels: part sensation fiction, part detective story, part political satire, and part ironic romance. It is also a highly revealing study of Victorian Britain, its colonial activities in Ireland and India, its veneration of wealth, and its pervasive dishonesty. In her introduction, Helen Small explores the central themes of lying and truth-telling, placing the novel within contemporary political and social debates. An invaluable appendix outlines the political context of the Palliser novels and establishes the internal chronology of the series and the relationship between fictional and actual political events, providing a unique understanding of the series as a linked narrative.

She uses women's own voices to reconstruct the inner chambers of a Chinese house where women with bound feet lived and worked. Focusing on the material aspects of footbinding and shoemaking--the tools needed, the procedures, the wealth of symbolism in the shoes, and the amazing regional variations in style--she contends that footbinding was a reasonable course of action for a woman who lived in a Confucian culture that placed the highest moral value on domesticity, motherhood, and handwork. Her absorbing, superbly detailed, and beautifully written book demonstrates that in the women's eyes, footbinding had less to do with the exotic or the sublime than with the mundane business of having to live in a woman's body in a man's world.<br><br>Footbinding was likely to have started in the tenth century among palace dancers. Ironically, it was meant not to cripple but to enhance their grace. Its meaning shifted dramatically as it became domesticated in the subsequent centuries, though the original hint of sensuality did not entirely disappear. This contradictory image of footbinding as at once degenerate and virtuous, grotesque and refined, is embodied in the key symbol for the practice--the lotus blossom, being both a Buddhist sign of piety and a poetic allusion to sensory pleasures.<br><br><i>Every Step a Lotus </i>includes almost one hundred illustrations of shoes from different regions of China, material paraphernalia associated with the customs and rituals of footbinding, and historical images that contextualize the narrative. Most of the shoes, from the collection of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, have not been exhibited before. Readers will come away from the book with a richer understanding of why footbinding carries such force as a symbol and why, long after its demise, it continues to exercise a powerful grip on our imaginations. <br><br><b>A Copublication with the Bata Shoe Museum</b></p><p><b>Dorothy Ko</b> is Professor of History at Barnard College, Columbia University. She is the author of <i>Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women &amp; Culture in Seventeenth-Century China</i> (1994).Foot binding is often cited as an emblem of the oppression of women and as such exerts a morbid fascination. But Ko, a history professor at Barnard, urges readers not to view the practice through modern eyes but to study it as a cultural phenomenon deeply embedded in Chinese history. Downplaying the tradition's erotic aspects, Ko offers a cogent discussion of Chinese women's lives during the eighteenth century, the pinnacle of the cult of the lotus foot. Mothers bound their daughters' feet, and foot binding evolved into a rite of passage into womanhood within the Confucian system, which valued female domesticity and textile arts. Shoe making became a highly prized craft and an integral part of the foot-binding ritual, and therefore Ko's enlightening narrative is accompanied by gorgeous reproductions of unbelievably tiny, exquisitely embroidered shoes for bound feet. As she identifies various shoe styles, interprets the complex symbolism of their elaborate designs, and elucidates the spiritual and religious aspects of foot binding, Ko convincingly defines the practice as a historical source of female identity, purpose, pride, and power. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Surveying how the judiciary has changed since his 1981 appointment, he engages the issues at stake today, suggesting how lawyers should argue cases and judges decide them, how trials can be improved, and, most urgently, how to cope with the dizzying pace of technological advance that makes litigation ever more challenging to judges and lawyers.</p><p>For Posner, legal formalism presents one of the main obstacles to tackling these problems. Formalist judges--most notably Justice Antonin Scalia--needlessly complicate the legal process by advocating "canons of constructions" (principles for interpreting statutes and the Constitution) that are confusing and self-contradictory. Posner calls instead for a renewed commitment to legal realism, whereby a good judge gathers facts, carefully considers context, and comes to a sensible conclusion that avoids inflicting collateral damage on other areas of the law. This, Posner believes, was the approach of the jurists he most admires and seeks to emulate: Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, Learned Hand, Robert Jackson, and Henry Friendly, and it is an approach that can best resolve our twenty-first-century legal disputes.</p></p><p>Richard A. Posner retired as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2017. He is a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.&#x201c;<i>Reflections on Judging</i>...is about what judges should do when confronted with complexity. Like the rest of us, judges face an increasingly bewildering world, marked by daily advances in such areas as social media, the sciences and globalization. Unlike the rest of us, judges must make decisions that enforce their understanding&#x2015;or misunderstanding&#x2015;of that complexity onto millions... [Posner&#x2019;s] willingness to speak to his readers&#x2015;judges or otherwise&#x2015;as a jurist with three decades of experience is a strength of this book... <i>Reflections on Judging</i> is spangled with legal cases in which Posner, faced with disorder, triumphantly cuts through the noise... In Richard A. Posner, our generation has its Learned Hand, its Henry Friendly. In complex times, we can take comfort in the simple fact of his existence.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kenji Yoshino</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Posner is a precise, erudite writer with a strong point of view enriched by specific examples accumulated over the course of three decades of professional experience and observation...

Quality is directly linked to productivity, competitiveness, customer satisfaction, business growth, elimination of waste and other non-value added activities, and overall business success. Cycle time and throughput is just as important in a hospital emergency room as it is in a semiconductor factory. Defects and errors don't occur just in factories, they occur in transactional and service business such as banks, insurance companies, and hospitals. Even your local&nbsp;and state&nbsp;governments have a keen interest in improving service quality in operations such as issuing drivers licenses and motor vehicle registration. The U.S. Navy has had an intensive quality improvement program for many years. <p>This book presents an organized approach to quality management, control, and improvement.&nbsp;Quality problems usually are the outcome of uncontrolled or excessive variability in product or service characteristics that are critical to the customer and statistical tools and other analytical methods play an important role in solving these problems. However, these techniques need to be implemented within a management structure that will ensure success. We focus on both the management structure and the statistical and analytical tools. Our approach to organizing and presenting this material is based on many years of teaching, research, and professional practice across a wide range of business and industrial settings.</p></p><p><p><strong>DOUGLAS C.

Inside a small, walled courtyard under a blue and blazing sky, there stands a refiner of metals. In his hands, gnarled with age, he is rolling and fingering a lump of ore. He watches the sun play on the streaks and veins of lead and other minerals running through this bit of rock chiseled from the bowels of the earth.<br><br>His experienced eye knows that, intermingled within this ore, there is silver.<br><br>He lays the ore on his worktable then builds his fire with care and the wisdom of years. Soon the flames are rising in the pit situated against the courtyard&#x2019;s stone wall.<br><br>At the worktable he picks up his hammer and begins crushing the lump into smaller pieces.<br><br>He pauses occasionally to stare at the fire, as if in study. From time to time he places more fuel upon the already-blazing coals and works his bellows until the flames are in a frenzy.<br><br>When the fire is right, he gathers the hammered bits of ore from the place of their crushing and lays them in a small, sturdy container of tempered pottery&#x2014;his crucible.<br><br>He places the crucible in the fire and sits down beside it. A long day is before him, and this is where he will stay for as long as the metal is subject to the flames. Silver is too precious to be forsaken in the furnace, too valuable to be ruined through inattention.<br><br>Carefully he watches the fire. It must be maintained at exactly the right temperature for the right duration of time to accomplish its purpose. Slowly the ore softens. The silver, with its greater density and lower melting point, liquefies first, hissing and bubbling as oxygen is released. The still-solid impurities rise to the top of the molten metal. This is the dross, and the refiner skims it off.<br><br>Now he adds bits of charcoal inside the crucible. He knows this will enhance the sheen of the silver. The carbon of the charcoal will keep the refined metal from reabsorbing oxygen from the air, which would only dull its finish.<br><br>He tends the fire, adds more fuel, and applies more air from the bellows. Amid the relentless heat surrounding the crucible, more dull impurities, newly revealed, rise to the surface of the mixture.<br><br>Again the refiner carefully skims away the murky, smudgy metal floating at the top of the crucible. Gazing down upon the molten surface, the refiner sees at best but a dim reflection of himself.<br><br>The refiner works and watches and waits. The heat and its effect continue. More impurities rise to the surface, and again he skims them off.<br><br>He never leaves the crucible unattended, never steps away from the fire he has formed to do its work. The finished product he cherishes demands this process. Only his guided and guarded refinement will yield the promised and precious metal.<br><br>And he is not yet satisfied.<br><br>He lets the fire cool. Eventually he sets the crucible aside.<br><br>Then once again he builds up the fire, and the process begins all over. This time the skilled refiner makes the fire hotter. Within the crucible, new impurities are released, brought to the surface, exposed for what they are, then skimmed off.<br><br>Finally his leathery face breaks into a smile, for now as he gazes into the liquid silver his reflection is apparent&#x2014;not yet sharp, but more distinct than before.<br><br>More hours pass as he perseveres in his anxious and delicate work. And then . . . once more he bends over the crucible, and this time he catches his breath. There it is! In the silver he sees what he has waited for so patiently: a clear image of himself, distinct and sharp.<br><br>Delight banishes his frown. His task is done. The impurities are gone.<br><br>The silver is refined.<br><br>He has his treasure.<br><br>He has &#x201c;choice&#x201d; silver, the most lustrous of all metals, beautiful and highly valued. It&#x2019;s as pale and shining as the wings of a dove, as brilliant and splendid as the moon, worthy to become coin or trumpet or ornament, worthy to grace the king&#x2019;s table or to reflect sunlight in a crown upon his head. The refiner has taken what was impure and made it pure.<br><br>He has taken what was dull and made it beautiful.<br><br>Potential value has become actual value.<br><br>And the fire&#x2014;the guarded, guided, relentless fire&#x2014;made the difference.<br><br>The fire allowed ordinary ore from the earth to be transformed into treasure.<br><br>All under the refiner&#x2019;s watchful care, for all the while he never left it unattended.<br><br>You and I are more than observers in this picture, beloved. This image of refinement is something God touches on again and again in His Word. He is the true Refiner. We are His silver.<br><br>And the fire is the fire of His making, for through His fire our Refiner will perfect an awesome work, a divine work. He will take what is impure and make it pure. He will take what is dull and make it beautiful. He&#x2019;ll take what is of potential value and reveal its actual value. He will transform us into treasure.<br><br>He&#x2019;ll refine us in the crucible so that He can see Himself in the silver&#x2014;in you and me. And so the world, as well as the principalities and powers and hosts of Satan, can behold the triumph of the Redeemer.<br><br>The fiery flames&#x2014;the array of disappointing situations in our lives, from minor irritants to major tragedies&#x2014;will make the difference. Different flames, different fires will come and go. In the pressure of their heat we&#x2019;ll see the impurities in our lives being released and rising to the top. Then He&#x2019;ll skim them off, purifying us, refining us.<br><br>He&#x2019;ll make the fire a little hotter, causing new impurities to rise and be released, exposed for what they are. These, too, He&#x2019;ll lift away. Early in our Christian lives He may see only a very dim image of Himself as He looks into our crucible. But as time goes on, His image becomes clearer, more lustrous, more beautiful.<br><br>And all the while, He never leaves or forsakes His treasure.<br><br>Our Refiner never leaves the crucible, never steps away from the fire. He is always there to make sure every flame that reaches us is exactly the right temperature&#x2014;not too hot!&#x2014;to accomplish its work in our lives. He knows the precise temperature to maintain so we don&#x2019;t face more than we can bear. He tests and proves our faith, not to discredit us, but to show us how far we&#x2019;ve come. He perfects our perseverance.<br><br>Years ago I filed away a copy of a poem called &#x201c;The Refiner&#x2019;s Fire.&#x201d; Now is the time to share it with you. Instead of silver, the metal here is gold, as in 1 Peter 1:7&#x2014;&#x201c;that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.&#x201d; But the process&#x2014;and the Refiner&#x2019;s attitude&#x2014;is just as we have seen, as the last two stanzas of this poem testify:<br><br>Can we think it pleases His loving heart<br>To cause us a moment&#x2019;s pain?<br>Ah, no, but He sees through the present cross<br>The bliss of eternal gain.<br>So He waited there with a watchful eye<br>With a love that is strong and sure,<br>And His gold did not suffer a bit more heat<br>Than was needed to make it pure.<br><br>The Refiner&#x2019;s fire is a picture of great worth and importance to God, one He refers to often in His Word. Let me share a few of these verses with you as we begin our study of how to handle the disappointments and difficulties God uses to refine us.<br><br>&#x201c;The refining pot is for silver . . . ,&#x201d; He says, &#x201c;but the LORD tests hearts&#x201d; (Proverbs 17:3).<br><br>&#x201c;The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold, and a man is tested by the praise accorded him&#x201d; (Proverbs 27:21). Even the praise we receive can be a refining and testing fire.<br><br>&#x201c;The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver&#x201d; (Proverbs 10:20). He even uses this image as a picture of His own Word: The words of the LORD are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times&#x201d; (Psalm 12:6). Seven is the number of completion, perfection&#x2014;God&#x2019;s Word is perfect and complete. And you will be too as you learn to respond to the fires in a way pleasing to God.<br><br>The Lord promises to bring His people &#x201c;through the fire,&#x201d; and to &#x201c;refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, and I will answer them; I will say, &#x2018;They are My people,&#x2019; and they will say, &#x201c;The LORD is my God&#x2019; &#x201d; (Zechariah 13:9).<br><br>We can all tell the Lord what the psalmist acknowledged, &#x201c;For Thou hast tried us, O God; Thou hast refined us as silver is refined&#x201d; (Psalm 66:10).<br><br>Yet unfortunately, there are times when God&#x2019;s refinement fires are of no avail.<br><br>Why? Because you and I can resist and ruin God&#x2019;s refining process. Jeremiah 6:29-30 describes this very situation as God speaks of His people Israel:<br><br>The bellows blow fiercely,<br>the lead is consumed by the fire;<br>in vain the refining goes on,<br>but the wicked are not separated.<br>They call them rejected silver,<br>because the LORD has rejected them.<br><br>The fire burns and burns. But the dross&#x2014;the wickedness, the impurities&#x2014;is not allowed to be released and removed. Instead it&#x2019;s held on to, stubbornly clung to, no matter how hot the Refiner&#x2019;s fire. So the silver becomes rejected silver or, as the King James Version puts it, &#x201c;reprobate silver.&#x201d;<br><br>Therefore the Refiner must reject it. It is impure and unusable and unattractive. God will send the fire several times and with increasing heat to get rid of those impurities, those un-Christlike things in your life and mine, beloved.<br><br>But if we insist on hanging on to them, then God must set us aside. He&#x2019;ll call us reprobate silver&#x2014;rejected for His use.<br>Could there be any more tragic and fearful conditio...</p><h2>World Receivers: Georgiana Houghton - Hilma af Klint - Emma Kunz</h2><p>Wassily Kandinsky is often recognized as the first artist to paint shapes and colors without regard to visual references in the world.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B.

They are found virtually everywhere and we love to watch them, listen to them, keep them as pets, wear their feathers, even converse with them. Birds, Jim Robbins posits, are our most vital connection to nature. They compel us to look to the skies, both literally and metaphorically; draw us out into nature to seek their beauty; and let us experience vicariously what it is like to be weightless. Birds have helped us in so many of our human endeavors: learning to fly, providing clothing and food, and helping us better understand the human brain and body. And they even have much to teach us about being human in the natural world.<br><br> This book illuminates qualities unique to birds that demonstrate just how invaluable they are to humankind&#x2014;both ecologically and spiritually. The wings of turkey buzzards influenced the Wright brothers&#x2019; flight design; the chickadee&#x2019;s song is considered by scientists to be the most sophisticated language in the animal world and a &#x201c;window into the evolution of our own language and our society&#x201d;; and the quietly powerful presence of eagles in the disadvantaged neighborhood of Anacostia, in Washington, D.C., proved to be an effective method for rehabilitating the troubled young people placed in charge of their care.<br><br> Exploring both cutting-edge scientific research and our oldest cultural beliefs, Robbins moves these astonishing creatures from the background of our lives to the foreground, from the quotidian to the miraculous, showing us that we must fight to save imperiled bird populations and the places they live, for the sake of both the planet and humankind.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Wonder of Birds</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A must-read, conveying much necessary information in easily accessible form and awakening one&#x2019;s consciousness to what might otherwise be taken for granted . . . <i>The Wonder of Birds</i> reads like the story of a kid let loose in a candy store and given free rein to sample.

Did it spring, fully formed, with perfect wings, from the mind of God? Or was the first act of flying carried out by a small dinosaur with feathers who leaped out of a tree, glided gently through the air, and landed on the ground like a child&#x2019;s balsa airplane? Did a galloping feathered dinosaur chase so fast after a buzzing insect, leaping to gobble it, that it found itself airborne? How flight first happened is a mystery, but in the birds that surround us today, which are the only surviving dinosaur lineage, some have found a look back at how dinosaurs might have gone airborne and what these creatures from long ago were like.<br><br>The governing theories about how the first animal evolved the ability to fly&#x2014;first proposed in the nineteenth century and still operable today&#x2014;are divided into two main camps, the arboreal and the cursorial. Derived from the Latin word for &#x201c;tree,&#x201d; the arboreal theory holds that around 125 million years ago, small reptilelike creatures with four limbs were covered with something like feathers. The featherlike covering was used not for flying but as a cloak to keep the creatures warm or as a way to look sexy and attract partners, or as camouflage, or all three. Perhaps these creatures leaped from tree to tree in a dense rainforest, the way a flying squirrel travels&#x2014;not really flying, but gliding.<br><br>Then one day, arborealists imagine, with its forelimbs stretched in front of it and its feather coverings spread out to the side, the first flying animal glided from a tree to the ground, and as it went on it added flapping to increase thrust. Perhaps the critter had a random genetic mutation that gave it larger forelimbs than others, which helped propel the animal forward. There are some sticky problems, however, that some argue shoot down the trees-to-ground theory, one of which is that there are no gliding animals today that flap for thrust.<br><br>The cursorial, or ground-up, theory of the origin of flight refers to the animal&#x2019;s ability to run. In this scenario, the first fliers were track stars with a yearning to take to the skies and soar. After zooming along the ground and making a series of leaps, to chase a dragonfly perhaps, or cross a creek, they somehow found themselves soaring with feathery forelimbs that had, perhaps through random mutations, grown large and light enough to keep them aloft. Left unexplained is where a heavy dinosaur would get the energy to run three times faster than modern birds in order to break the bonds of gravity and flap its way through the air, all with a developing wing. Perhaps, some have thought, they were half wings on a bipedal, or two-legged, creature, but why would an animal have a half wing if only a full wing would allow it to fly?<br><br>It&#x2019;s a good question, and one that&#x2019;s often asked when it comes to the evolution of flight. &#x201c;What good is half a wing?&#x201d; was first asked in 1871 by St. George Jackson Mivart, an English biologist. Mivart was at first devoted to Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection&#x2014;the idea that as creatures evolved, only those who were most fit survived. He turned against his mentor, though, and later became one of the theory&#x2019;s most vehement critics&#x2014;largely over the bird wing. There is no reason on God&#x2019;s green earth for an animal to have half wings, because they are useless, he claimed. Ergo, the theory of evolution doesn&#x2019;t make sense; God must have created birds fully formed. To this day, creationists hold fast to the argument that half a bird wing refutes evolution.<br><br>This is where the first-flying-creature debate has stood for quite a while&#x2014;two main schools of thought arguing about their respective ideas, with a separate school believing that a bird&#x2019;s wing is a result of the act of divine creation, rather than meticulous and persistent shaping by eons of evolution.<br><br>A new perspective that combined aspects of both evolutionary theories arose when Ken Dial weighed in in the early 2000s. While his distinguished career has been about studying bird flight mechanics, he found that his approach could also be uniquely applied to the evolution of flight. &#x201c;Study the dinosaurs that made it&#x2014;the birds,&#x201d; he says. Understanding more about the evolution of flight by studying living animals provides a new perspective on the ecology and biology of birds and dinosaurs, information that can&#x2019;t be gotten elsewhere. &#x201c;These are things you would never get from studying fossils,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>With his shaved head, goatee, and glistening aviator sunglasses, the guitar-playing, jet-piloting Dial is perfect for the role of a renegade. He&#x2019;s a bird nut, as many people who investigate birds are, energetic and excited when talking about his research. The fact that he&#x2019;s an interloper on the subject, wading as a biologist into a field occupied largely by paleontologists, doesn&#x2019;t bother him. The origin-of-flight theorists base their respective arguments on the study of fossilized dinosaur bones. This necessarily involves a lot of conjecture because the beasts are so long gone, and their bodies are very unbirdlike at this point because they are fossils frozen in stone. Dial&#x2019;s work is based on videos of hundreds of live birds performing in his lab, doing things that no one knew birds did, as well as his study of their muscles, limbs, and other mechanics. I watched several of these films with Dial in his office at the Flight Laboratory in Missoula, part of the University of Montana, and I asked him how he thinks bird flight first took off. His is a fascinating idea, based, in part, he told me, on something called &#x201c;recapitulation theory,&#x201d; a theory that is largely rejected by science but that Dial has resurrected.<br><br>Recapitulation theory is a notion that goes back to ancient Egypt, though it was formalized in the nineteenth century by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel. It holds that the early development of a single animal mirrors the evolutionary history of the species. Very young human embryos look like fish, for example, as the theory poses that our human ancestors did long ago. Dial doesn&#x2019;t agree that this is true all of the time, but he believes it sometimes appears to be true.<br><br>Students in a graduate seminar he was teaching in the late 1990s, Dial tells me, helped set him on his path to investigate how flight may have first developed. As part of their assignment, they studied the origin of flight and interviewed published researchers in both the arboreal and cursorial schools. They concluded that there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of good data for either theory. So at the end of the seminar, the students issued Dial a challenge. Why didn&#x2019;t he, the functional morphologist, do some research and come up with a new take on this question of the origin of flight? Dial thought that was a fine idea, since the study of the subject is indeed &#x201c;very limited by the fact that the animal has been replaced by stone. It&#x2019;s not moving, just an anatomy left for us to try and interpret.&#x201d; The two theories, based on fossils and very little concrete evidence, &#x201c;constitute a lot of arm waving and little data,&#x201d; according to Dial. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to come up with a hypothesis with a simple dead structure you want to fit into your story. That&#x2019;s just storytelling. My feeling was that we need to understand broadly and in depth the anatomy and physiology of the living.&#x201d; Dial believed he could use his high-speed cameras and other sophisticated instrumentation to come up with some new ideas about the origin of flight.<br><br>Dial is well suited to take on the subject from a new angle. He&#x2019;s observed hundreds of species of wild birds for decades and taught field courses on birds across Africa. As a researcher, he has long and meticulously studied the physiology of birds, every component part, muscle, nerve, and bone, and how this equipment determines how birds fly and run. As the host of the acclaimed series All Bird TV on the Discovery Channel, he has also traveled across North and Central America, filming birds in the field and interviewing a wide range of other bird experts.<br><br>It was in an unlikely source that Dial found a glimpse into the likely origins of flight: baby birds, who, in those first few weeks of their existence, he believes, provide a detailed look at the millions of years it took for the ability to fly to evolve. It&#x2019;s just one example of how modern-day birds inform our knowledge about the very distant past.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to fathom the notion that the feathery little creatures that flock to our feeders are modern-day dinosaurs, but it&#x2019;s true. All birds are, though chickens and turkeys are genetically the closest dinosaur relatives. Researchers, in fact, have manipulated chicken genetics so chicks grow dinosaurlike beaks, feet, and legs. It took a scientific revolution to overthrow the notion that dinosaurs were reptiles, an idea that purportedly arose in 1868, when the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, so fierce an adherent to the idea of natural selection that he was known as Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog, was eating dinner one evening while thinking about a dinosaur bone he had earlier been working with in the lab. As he nibbled on the bottom of a turkey drumstick, he was struck by its similarity to the anklebone of the dinosaur.<br><br>There was also a peculiar fossil find in 1861 in Germany that fueled such thinking, the discovery of the archaeopteryx. About the size of a raven, the strange creature had broad wings and long feathers, and could fly, or at least glide, but actually had more in common with small dinosaurs than birds, including sharp teeth and a long bony tail. Archaeopteryx was a theropod&#x2014;Greek for &#x201c;beast feet&#x201d;&#x2014;a group that includes small to gigantic dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex, with feet similar to birds. Theropods had numerous other birdlike features: They brooded their eggs, had bones filled with air pockets to make them lighter, and in many cases had feathers and a wishbone, or furcula.<br><br>Birds and dinosaurs, Huxley thought, had to be related. It was a marked departure from the prevailing idea in the nineteenth century that birds were descended from a predinosaur reptile. It also implied that they had been warm-blooded, not cold. Huxley&#x2019;s idea got little traction, and the notion of a bird-dinosaur connection was largely forgotten. In the 1960s, though, Yale University&#x2019;s John Ostrom found twenty-two features in the skeletons of dinosaurs that were also found in birds, and he refloated the hypothesis. The &#x201c;dinosaur wars&#x201d; were under way, reaching a fever pitch in the 1980s as experts battled over whether dinosaurs were birdlike or reptilelike. By the 1990s, though, the matter was largely settled science.<br><br>Because they are related to dinosaurs, birds have been enlisted by scientists to tell us something about their ancestors. Dial turned to an unlikely subject&#x2014;a baby chukar partridge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worked in the lab with everything from pigeons and starlings, parakeets, magpies, finches, ducks, geese, and swans,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but chukars fit the bill.&#x201d;<br><br>There are two forms in which birds are born into the world. One is altricial, which means &#x201c;requires nourishment.&#x201d; Altricial birds, such as the robin, are feeble, naked, and helpless after they burst through their eggshell, and they need days of doting care from parents who keep them warm and stuff food into their perpetually wide-open mouths as they develop feathers and the ability to fly. The other radically different way birds arrive is precocial, mind-bogglingly mature at birth, able to walk or run, evade predators, and forage for food on their own. Precocialism occurs along a spectrum and is especially pronounced in ground birds, who are most susceptible to predators. Some unusual birds, such as the megapodes&#x2014;&#x201c;large foot&#x201d;&#x2014;of Australia and New Zealand, are superprecocial, which means they are the most mature birds at birth of all. And Australian brush turkeys are the champions of superprecocial behavior.<br><br>Brush turkeys are bold, with no fear whatsoever of people. These days, they hang out in parks, near malls, and in other suburban settings. They look something like the wild turkeys found in North America&#x2014;a deep blue-black color, with a bright head and flat tail. They forage through leaves and grass on the forest floor for seeds, fruit, mice, frogs, and other small animals, and they build unusual giant communal nests out of leaves and twigs that can be as large as twelve feet wide and six feet tall. They are known as incubator birds, because when the hens lay their customary eighteen to twenty-four large white eggs, the heat from a compost pile they build beneath the nest radiates up to keep the eggs warm. The males tend the eggs carefully, sticking their beaks into the compost to monitor its temperature and adjusting the mix to make it warmer or cool it down.<br><br>As soon as the babies peck their way out of the shell they are ready to roll. At one day old&#x2014;one day!&#x2014;the fully feathered chick&#x2019;s eyes are wide open, and it literally hits the ground running. With extremely powerful legs and feet, these little chicks are able to fly and climb vertically up trees and rocks, abilities that allow them to evade snakes, dingoes, and other predators. &#x201c;The hatchlings are very comfortable on extraordinary slopes, with no panting or stress, doing it over and over again,&#x201d; says Dial. On that magical first day, a baby brush turkey can fly and run up steep and rocky cliffs better than an adult, though that ability eventually diminishes.<br><br>The chukar partridges that Dial studies are also precocial&#x2014;though not superprecocial&#x2014;ground birds. Chukar partridges are small and stocky, a member of the Galliform family, which also includes chickens and pheasants. They have a distinctive white face with a black gorget, or collar, of dark feathers. They favor dry, harsh terrain, and they eat a mixed diet, a buffet of insects, grass seed, roots, and whatever else they can scrounge. They were introduced to the United States from the deserts and mountains of their native Pakistan because they are fast and flap furiously when they take flight, which makes them an appealing quarry for bird hunters.<br><br>Chukars, like the pheasant and ostrich, lay their eggs in a depression in the ground. After a couple of weeks, the young hatch, and within twelve hours they run and start foraging for food, though they are still occasionally tended to by parents. There was something in the chukars, Dial thought, that was very dinosaur-like&#x2014;it was the way they used their four appendages, something he calls &#x201c;wing and leg cooperative use.&#x201d; They also maintained a wildness about them when he brought them into the lab. The Japanese quail he was using, on the other hand, which are commonly used as lab animals, were docile and sat quietly in his hand as he stroked them. Chukars could be raised and handled, yet they remained skittish and fled when he came near them&#x2014;a perfect combination of traits, he says, for studying how they learn to fly as a window into how the dinosaurs might first have learned to take to the air.</p><h2>Cengage Advantage Books: Essentials of the Legal Environment Today</h2><p>Current, succinct, and straightforward, ESSENTIALS OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, 5E uses a nontechnical approach to deliver complete one-semester coverage of business law and its environment.

He believes that the heart of all philosophical thinking is the quest for &#34;true Being&#34; and that &#34;the man who attains true awareness of his freedom gains certainty of God.&#34; In Jasper&#39;s view a man&#39;s philosophy, like the life process itself, must undergo a continuous change as a result of the development and needs of the individual and the crises he must experience. In &#34;Way to Wisdom&#34; he gives a brilliant and exciting introduction to an understanding of philosophy and offers the serious reader an approach to a deeper understanding.</p><p>German philosopher, physician, and psychiatrist <b>Karl Jaspers</b> was born in 1883 and died in 1969. The great translator Ralph Manheim rendered in English such twentieth-century classics as G�nter Grass&#x2019; <i>The Tin Drum </i>and<i> </i>Louis-Ferdinand Celine&#x2019;s <i>Journey to the End of the Night. </i><b>Richard M. Owsley</b>, professor of philosophy at North Texas University, is president of the Karl Jaspers Society of North America.<br>&#34;An eloquent expression of a great hope that philosophy may again become an activity really relevant not only to the perennial problems of life and death but to the unusual configurations of such problems in our time.&#34;</p><h2>Desert Islands: and Other Texts, 1953-1974 (Semiotext(e) / Foreign Agents)</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating anthology of texts and interviews written over 20 years by renowned French philosopher Gilles Deleuze.</b></p><p>"One day, perhaps, this century will be Deleuzian," Michel Foucault once wrote. This book anthologizes 40 texts and interviews written over 20 years by renowned French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who died in 1995. The early texts, from 1953-1966 (on Rousseau, Kafka, Jarry, etc.), belong to literary criticism and announce Deleuze's last book, Critique and Clinic (1993). But philosophy clearly predominates in the rest of the book, with sharp appraisals of the thinkers he always felt indebted to: Spinoza, Bergson. More surprising is his acknowledgement of Jean-Paul Sartre as his master. "The new themes, a certain new style, a new aggressive and polemical way of raising questions," he wrote, "come from Sartre." But the figure of Nietzsche remains by far the most seminal, and the presence throughout of his friends and close collaborators, Felix Guattari and Michel Foucault. The book stops shortly after the publication of Anti-Oedipus, and presents a kind of genealogy of Deleuze's thought as well as his attempt to leave philosophy and connect it to the outside&#x2015;but, he cautions, as a philosopher.</p></p><p>Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes/Saint Denis. He published 25 books, including five in collaboration with F�lix Guattari.<br><br>David Lapoujade (born in 1964) is a French philosopher and a professor at the Universit� Paris-I Panth�on-Sorbonne. In addition to editing the posthumous collections of Deleuze's writings,<i> Desert Islands</i> and <i>Two Regimes of Madness</i> (both published in English by Semiotext(e)), he has written on pragmatism and the work of William James.</p><h2>How to Keep Slim, Healthy and Young With Juice Fasting</h2><p>Rejuvenating, reducing and healing power of juices.

He boarded a friend&#x2019;s yacht, sailed into the calm blue waters of Long Island Sound, and--poof!--disappeared. He would not be heard from again for five days. What happened during those five days, and in the days and weeks that followed, was so incredible that, even when the truth was finally revealed, many Americans simply would not believe it. <p><i>The President Is a Sick Man</i> details an extraordinary but almost unknown chapter in American history: Grover Cleveland&#x2019;s secret cancer surgery and the brazen political cover-up by a politician whose most memorable quote was &#x201c;Tell the truth.&#x201d; When an enterprising reporter named E. J. Edwards exposed the secret operation, Cleveland denied it. The public believed the &#x201c;Honest President,&#x201d; and Edwards was dismissed as &#x201c;a disgrace to journalism.&#x201d; The facts concerning the disappearance of Grover Cleveland that summer were so well concealed that even more than a century later a full and fair account has never been published.

She received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles. Since moving to Pomona in 1985, she has taught a wide variety of courses in nineteenth- and twentieth-century North American art. Her work has focused on the art of the United States, in particular the work of Ben Shahn, about whom she has written two books, and the relationship between the visual arts and working-class culture. Professor Pohl has taught in the United States for many years, but her Canadian origins give her a unique continental perspective on American art.</p>The political, industrial, and cultural revolutions that punctuated the 19th century were reflected in the fine arts, though not always consciously. Art was no longer the sole domain of the upper classes, and the complexity of the new social order became evident in the works of artists like Blake and Goya early in the century and Cassatt and Eakins later on. In this first comprehensive reconsideration of 19th-century art from the viewpoint of the "new" art history, Eisenman and four other art historians examine issues of class, gender, racism, and Eurocentrism as they pertain to North American and European art. This handsomely produced volume, rich in ideas and illustrations, complements the works of Albert Boime (e.g., The Art of Exclusion: Representing Blacks in the Nineteenth Century, Smithsonian, 1990).

It was the medium of watercolor, however, that encouraged him in his development of a bold, original style that is both contemporary and authentically American. Marin&#x2019;s improvisational approach to color, paint handling, perspective, and movement situated him as a leading figure in modern art and helped influence the Abstract Expressionist movement.</p><p><i>John Marin&#x2019;s Watercolors </i>is the first book to present the Art Institute of Chicago&#x2019;s impressive collection of his works in its entirety, ranging from early images rooted in traditional practice to more experimental compositions. It explores the artist&#x2019;s working method, his modernist vision as it developed through etching and into watercolor, and his intuitive investigation of the inherent properties of his watercolor to craft a new, avant-garde methodology. The works are organized chronologically and grouped according to the sites where they were painted, including New York City, France and the Tyrol, the Maine coastline, and the New Mexico desert.</p><p>Marin had a strong regard for the presentation of his watercolors, and a&nbsp;section illuminates how he chose frames and mounts&nbsp;for each work. The Art Institute&#x2019;s significant collection of Marin&#x2019;s original frames and mounts were bequeathed to the museum, along with some 50 watercolors, by legendary photographer, dealer, and collector Alfred Stieglitz. Marin&#x2019;s and Stieglitz&#x2019;s attitudes toward presentation are discussed, and the frames are documented with photographic and written descriptions.</p></p><p><b>Martha Tedeschi</b> is Curator of Prints and Drawings and <b>Kristi Dahm</b> is Assistant Conservator of Prints and Drawings, both at the Art Institute of Chicago. <b>Ruth Fine</b> is Curator for Special Projects in Modern Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.

It was funded by British-Jewish interests. Its director was rumored to work for British intelligence. A precursor to Penguin, it distributed both middlebrow fiction and works by edgier modernist authors such as D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Ernest Hemingway to eager continental readers. Yet Albatross printed and sold its paperbacks in English from the heart of Hitler&#x2019;s Reich.<br><br> In her original and skillfully researched history, Michele K. Troy reveals how the Nazi regime tolerated Albatross&#x2014;for both economic and propaganda gains&#x2014;and how Albatross exploited its insider position to keep Anglo-American books alive under fascism. In so doing, Troy exposes the contradictions in Nazi censorship while offering an engaging detective story, a history, a nuanced analysis of men and motives, and a cautionary tale.</p><p><b>Michele K.

The explanations are clear and simple and minimize calculations where possible. A diverse range of applications and examples are presented to make the materials appealing to a wide range of learners. <b> </b> The Eighth Edition features new problems, more real data based examples and exercises, and fuller integration of technology. <b> </b> For individuals beginning a study of statistics. </p></p><p>The objective of Statistics: A First Course, Sixth Edition, is to lay a foundation in statistics early in a student&#39;s academic career. With the Sixth Edition, Freund and Simon have enhanced the level of mathematical precision of previous editions without complicating the overall presentation of the text.<p> This book is intended primarily for use in a first course in statistics. There is a systematic academic approach in <i>Statistics: A First Course,</i> 8th edition. Its emphasis is on instruction in meaningful, well-established statistical techniques. The future would-be medical doctor, business executive, scientist, teacher, or other professional specialist must comprehend and be skillful in the application of basic statistical tools and methodology. The student's knowledge of statistics is greatly enhanced by repeated exposure to statistical exercises. The book contains a wide selection of nearly 1,000 exercises, presented throughout the text. The book also offers a large number of detailed illustrations and examples, in each chapter, designed to provide guidance to readers. </p> <p> Important formulas, definitions, and rules are highlighted within colored boxes. The frequently used tables for normal and <i>t</i> distributions are repeated on the inside back cover, and the inside front cover contains an indexed glossary of statistical symbols. </p> <p> As in previous editions, controversy has not been avoided. The reader is exposed to the weaknesses of statistical techniques, as well as their strengths. It is hoped that this honest approach will provide a stimulus as well as a challenge. </p> <p> For instructors who have used previous editions of this textbook, it should be noted that the problem sets have been extensively revised. Many additional real data-based problems have been added. Internal referencing within the problem sets has been minimized. Where necessary, pertinent data has been repeated to free students from the unproductive "busy work" of flipping back to previous problems. </p> <p><b>USE OF TECHNOLOGY</b></p> <p> The book makes extensive use of technology such as the computer, graphing calculator, and MINITAB, but their importance should not be overstated. The entire text is built around the authors' goal of presenting statistics at a level that is appropriate and interesting for beginning students. <i>In spite of their obvious value, computers and graphing calculators can safely be eliminated by readers of this textbook without loss of continuity.</i> </p> <p> This edition uses, but does not require, MINITAB. MINITAB printouts, showing both output and session commands, are set off in boxes and are referenced in the examples. MINITAB users will be pleased by the new opportunity for students to purchase this textbook packaged with a CD-ROM containing the data files for this book. </p> <p> Although it is not required, this edition also uses the graphing calculator and acquaints the reader with its numerous benefits. <i>Using Technology: The Graphing Calculator</i> boxes appear throughout the book. These boxes provide keystrokelevel instruction for using the TI-83 to find solutions to selected examples in the book. </p> <p> Appendix A, <i>TI-83</i> Tips, written by Dorothy Wakefield of the University of Connecticut and Kathleen McLaughlin of Manchester Community College, provides additional help in using the graphing calculator. </p> <p> Many problems are designed to be solved with the aid of a computer or a graphing calculator and are identified with a technology icon. </p> <p><b>OTHER FEATURES</b></p> <p> <i>Review</i> sections are presented at two- or three-chapter intervals throughout the book. Five review sections reinforce connections outside the context of a particular section or chapter.

A staple of engineering courses around the world for more than three decades, it has been revised and updated regularly by the authors, a pair of recognized experts in the field. The text addresses the implications, limitations, and meanings of many aspects of heat transfer, connecting the subject to its real-world applications and developing students' insight into related phenomena. <br>Three introductory chapters form a minicourse in heat transfer, covering all of the subjects discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. This unique and effective feature introduces heat exchangers early in the development, rather than at the end. The authors also present a novel and simplified method for dimensional analysis, and they capitalize on the similarity of natural convection and film condensation to develop these two topics in a parallel manner. Worked examples and end-of-chapter exercises appear throughout the book, along with well-drawn, illuminating figures.</p><p>John H.

Hoban's full-color photos have an astonishing clarity and glow to them. They include interesting and beautiful urban landscapes, portraits and still life. Children will have fun speculating about the photographsor they can simply enjoy them, no comment necessary. Looking at this book for shapes is a little like looking at a Cezanne for shapes. Nevertheless, circles, stars, triangles and even fancier geometric figures like trapezoids are here in abundance. The 11 figures represented, as well as the photographs, reach well beyond Hoban's earlier books about shapes.

H. Gombrich's <i>A Little History of the World</i>, an equally irresistible volume that brings history's greatest philosophers to life</b><br><br> Philosophy begins with questions about the nature of reality and how we should live. These were the concerns of Socrates, who spent his days in the ancient Athenian marketplace asking awkward questions, disconcerting the people he met by showing them how little they genuinely understood. This engaging book introduces the great thinkers in Western philosophy and explores their most compelling ideas about the world and how best to live in it.</p><p>In forty brief chapters, Nigel Warburton guides us on a chronological tour of the major ideas in the history of philosophy. He provides interesting and often quirky stories of the lives and deaths of thought-provoking philosophers from Socrates, who chose to die by hemlock poisoning rather than live on without the freedom to think for himself, to Peter Singer, who asks the disquieting philosophical and ethical questions that haunt our own times.</p><p>Warburton not only makes philosophy accessible, he offers inspiration to think, argue, reason, and ask in the tradition of Socrates. <i>A Little History of Philosophy</i> presents the grand sweep of humanity's search for philosophical understanding and invites all to join in the discussion.</p></p><p>Why did you write this book? <br> <br>Philosophy is one of the most stimulating and important subjects there is. We all philosophize some of the time when we think about how we should live, whether or not God exists, or how society should be organized. These questions have vexed the greatest minds for thousands of years. Yet some people are still daunted by philosophy. They think it's an impenetrable and obscure subject that has no relevance for them. I wanted to show this isn't true, that it's possible to write an accessible and enjoyable book without betraying the spirit of the great thinkers of the past or making them obscure or irrelevant. I decided to focus on the Western tradition in philosophy and on one or two key ideas from each philosopher discussed rather than attempt an encyclopedic overview. <br> <br>How is making philosophy accessible to all a challenge? <br> <br>Part of the challenge of writing a book like this was to keep the language straightforward. Many philosophers have introduced complex technical terms that make their writing hard to follow. It's easy to fall into the habit of mirroring them. Writing in a way that doesn't presuppose knowledge is an excellent discipline, though, as there's no place to hide. <br> <br>Which philosophers do you personally find most engaging? <br> <br>Socrates, the great fifth-century Athenian philosopher who would cross-question passersby in the marketplace and reveal how little they really knew, is one of my personal favourites. His unwillingness to accept assumptions, and his passion for discovering the truth or, failing that, how little he knew, provide a model for all philosophers. Although he wasn't the first philosopher, he was the first great philosopher. He of all the philosophers in the book is the one I'd most like to have met. My second choice would be the eighteenth-century philosopher David Hume, a remarkable thinker who was also a superb writer. <br> <br>What are the major themes of your book? <br> <br> <i>A Little History of Philosophy</i> focuses on the major themes of philosophy: appearance and reality, the nature of the self, and questions about God's existence and about how we should live, both individually and as members of society. Throughout philosophy's history these have been the perennial themes. Each era gives them a new twist, but they aren't going to go away.<b>Nigel Warburton</b> is a freelance philosopher, bestselling author of many popular introductions to philosophy, and co-host of the much-loved Philosophy Bites podcast.

Born Ram�n Samaniego to a prominent Mexican family, Novarro arrived in Hollywood in 1916 as a refugee from the civil wars that rocked Mexico in the early 20th century. By the mid-1920s, he had become one of MGM's most important leading men, going on to star in a series of now classic films including The Student Prince, Mata Hari, and the original version of Ben-Hur. He shared the screen with the era's most important leading ladies such as Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy, Joan Crawford, and Norma Shearer and become Rudolph Valentino's main rival in the "Latin Lover" category. But despite his considerable professional accomplishments, Novarro's most enduring claim to fame is his tragic death - his bloodied corpse was found in his house on Halloween 1968 in what has become one of the most infamous scandals in the vast lore of Hollywood.<br><br>Novarro was a life-long bachelor who had carefully cultivated his image as a man deeply devoted to his family and to his religious convictions. His murder shattered that image as it was revealed to the general public that the dashing screen hero had been not only homosexual, but had been killed by two young male hustlers. Since then, his death has achieved near mythic proportions. Increasingly outlandish stories have become accepted as truth, obscuring Novarro's notable professional legacy.<br><br><i>Beyond Paradise</i> presents for the first time a full picture of the man who made motion picture history - from his amazing rise to stardom to the destructive conflicts faced by this traditional Catholic Mexican man who was also a gay film star. Compellingly told and impressively researched - including original interviews with Novarro's surviving friends, family, co-workers and the two men convicted of his murder - Beyond Paradise provides a unique insight into the groundbreaking life and career of one of the most important early Hollywood stars - a man whose myth continues to fascinate today.<br></p><p>A biography of the religious and deeply closeted rival to Rudolph Valentino<b>Andr� Soares</b> was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

What Susskind sees is eye-opening-a legal world of virtual courts, Internet-based global legal businesses, online document production, commoditized service, legal process outsourcing, and web-based simulated practice. Legal markets will be liberalized, with new jobs for lawyers and new employers too. <br><br><em>Tomorrow's Lawyers</em> is a definitive guide to this future--for young and aspiring lawyers, and for all who want to modernize our legal and justice systems. It introduces the new legal landscape and offers practical guidance for those who intend to build careers and businesses in law. Susskind identifies the key drivers of change, such as the economic downturn, and considers how these will shape the legal marketplace. He then sketches out the new legal landscape as he envisions it, highlighting the changing role of law firms-and in-house lawyers-and the coming of virtual hearings and online dispute resolution. He also suggests solutions to major concerns within the legal profession, such as diminishing public funding, and explores alternative roles for future lawyers in a world increasingly dominated by IT. And what are the prospects for aspiring lawyers? Susskind predicts what new jobs and new employers there will be, equipping prospective lawyers with penetrating questions to put to their current and future bosses.<br><br><em>Tomorrow's Lawyers</em> is an essential roadmap to the future of law for those who want to survive the rapidly changing legal landscape.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Susskind OBE</strong> is an acclaimed author, speaker, and independent adviser to international professional firms and national governments.

Prominent among these pagan critics was Porphyry of Tyre (ca. 232-ca. 305 C.E.), scholar, philosopher, and student of religions. His book Against the Christians (Kata Christianon), was condemned to be burned by the imperial Church in 448. It survives only in fragments preserved by the cleric and teacher Macarius Magnes.This new translation of the remains of Against the Christians, by renowned biblical scholar R. Joseph Hoffmann, reveals a work of deft historical and literary criticism. Porphyry&#39;s trenchant comments extend to key figures, beliefs, and doctrines of Christianity as he roundly attacks the divinity of Jesus, the integrity of the apostles, the Christian concept of God, and the Resurrection. Porphyry dismisses the gospels as the work of charlatans and Jesus himself as a criminal and failure. In short, the gospels, as a collective account of the life and deeds of Jesus, are hardly worth the reverence with which an increasing number of Christian converts of Porphyry&#39;s own day have begun treating them.Critical notes by the translator provide a running commentary to the text. A lively introduction and comprehensive epilogue describe the &#34;buildup&#34; to the pagan critique of Christianity, and help put Porphyry&#39;s work in historical perspective.Accessible to the general reader, and a valuable scholarly tool as well, this new translation of Against the Christians proves a worthy addition to both classical and patristic studies.</p><p>Following graduation from Harvard Divinity School and the University of Oxford,<b>&nbsp;R.

Affiliated with discontinuity, alarm, and silence, it raises fundamental questions about the constitution of self and other, the stability of location, systems of transfer, and the destination of speech. Profoundly changing our concept of long-distance, it is constantly transmitting effects of real and evocative power. To the extent that it always relates us to the absent other, the telephone, and the massive switchboard attending it, plugs into a hermeneutics of mourning. <i>The Telephone Book</i>, itself organized by a "telephonic logic," fields calls from philosophy, history, literature, and psychoanalysis. It installs a switchboard that hooks up diverse types of knowledge while rerouting and jamming the codes of the disciplines in daring ways. Avital Ronell has done nothing less than consider the impact of the telephone on modern thought. Her highly original, multifaceted inquiry into the nature of communication in a technological age will excite everyone who listens in. <p>The book begins by calling close attention to the importance of the telephone in Nazi organization and propaganda, with special regard to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. In the Third Reich the telephone became a weapon, a means of state surveillance, "an open accomplice to lies." Heidegger, in Being and Time and elsewhere, elaborates on the significance of "the call." In a tour de force response, Ronell mobilizes the history and terminology of the telephone to explicate his difficult philosophy.</p><p>Ronell also speaks of the appearance of the telephone in the literary works of Duras, Joyce, Kafka, Rilke, and Strindberg. She examines its role in psychoanalysis&#x2014;Freud said that the unconscious is structured like a telephone, and Jung and R. D. Laing saw it as a powerful new body part. She traces its historical development from Bell's famous first call: "Watson, come here!" Thomas A. Watson, his assistant, who used to communicate with spirits, was eager to get the telephone to talk, and thus to link technology with phantoms and phantasms. In many ways a meditation on the technologically constituted state, <i>The Telephone Book</i> opens a new field, becoming the first political deconstruction of technology, state terrorism, and schizophrenia. And it offers a fresh reading of the American and European addiction to technology in which the telephone emerges as the crucial figure of this age.</p></p><p>&#39;Ronell...releases the ways we look at ordinary objects- the phone, the book- and encourages us to question our assumptions about the way things are. This thinking sets us up for an appreciation of the freakiness of the telephone, an object that P.T. Barnum felt uneasy about having in his freakshow because a limb without a human subject, as opposed to humans without limbs, would be too scary for his audience.&#39; -Boston ReveiwAvital Ronell is an associate professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley.

Sure, some stress is inevitable, but being &#34;stressed out&#34; isn&#39;t. In fact, we can learn to rechannel the powerful stress activators in our lives to make us even more effective. Hamlet spoke of &#34;suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.&#34; These days we simply use the word &#34;stress&#34; to describe that feeling. And if you ask 10 random people if they feel stressed, chances are that at least 9 will reply with a resounding, &#34;Yes!&#34; Indeed, the very way we use the word implies that we are its victims-as in, &#34;I&#39;m under so much stress&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m completely stressed out.&#34; There&#39;s now a better way to look at this picture, a way to move from victim to victor. The first step is to look to the science behind it all because in the science lies a whole new message about stress. Science allows us to understand what the stress response is and why our bodies react the way they do. Like all living creatures, we&#39;re mapped to respond instinctually in certain ways, and generally for good reasons. We know, for example, that in times of emergency, we effortlessly shift into a different biological mode. Based on our perception of the crisis, our brains initiate the &#34;stress response&#34; or the &#34;flight-or-fight reaction.&#34; Our attention becomes keenly focused. Our heart and lungs accelerate to ready us for action. Our glands mobilize extra energy resources and summon the immune system to battle stations. This whole process is Nature&#39;s way of empowering us to respond swiftly, sometimes dramatically, to sudden events, while remaining mentally alert and physically prepared to meet a challenge. But what if the crisis situation does not present us with a foe to be fought? Or if fleeing is not the answer? Too often in modern times, the situations that bring on the stress response require neither the fight nor flight response for which our bodies are genetically programmed. The stress response is nevertheless likely to</p><p>"You think you know what stress is, but not like you will after you've read The End of Stress as We Know It.

It's very informative, and a great read." -- Joseph LeDoux, Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, NYU, and author of Synaptic Self and The Emotional Brain <p>"Famed stress researcher Bruce McEwen draws on a vast amount of research (much of it his own) to explain in everyday language everything you need to know in order to make your life less stressful.

It is the place where you plug into the Earth and its life-supporting energies. Discovered by Canadian researcher Fran Nixon in the 1960's, the Vivaxis connection is fundamental to human life and health. It sustains and renews us, and affects every aspect of our lives--it even affects how we digest food and resist illness. This unsuspected link between our body and a particular spot on the Earth can make all the difference between heatlh and illness, says Dr. Judy Jacka, the world's leading authority on the new science of Vivaxis. But your Vivaxis connection can be harmed, polluted, or distorted. It can be damaged by chemicals, electromagnetic fields, even lightning. A disturbed Vivaxis connection can make you ill, but restored and vibrant, your Vivaxis connection can keep you healthy. In this ground-breaking book, Dr. Jacka presents more than two dozen easy-to-follow how-to exercises that take you step-by-step through the science of Vivaxis. You'll learn how to energize your Vivaxis, heal it, work with it, and use it to improve almost every aspect of your life. You can even use it to improve the energy health and feel of your home or workplace. The discovery of the Vivaxis connection is a crucial milstone in the field of alternative medicine, showing how energetic connections between the planet and our bodies determine health and how natural therapies actually work.

It took Stephen two and a half years to draw the wonderful illustrations for the best-selling Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections, which was published in 1992. That volume was the inspiration for a new range of cross-section books which include Man-of-War (1993), Castle (1994), Incredible Pop-Up Cross-Sections (1995), Incredible Explosions (1996), Incredible Everything (1997), Incredible Body (1998), and DK Amazing Pop-Up 3D Time Scape (1999).

The oversize format lends itself to the many tiny, meticulous full-color illustrations that occupy the pages. The size, however, does not lend itself to library shelving. The text and illustrations are arranged according to a table of contents with one to five topics per two-page spread. Among the incredible everythings are plywood, compact discs, plastic bottles, soap, athletic shoes, and photocopiers. The Saturn V occupies a double fold-out that will quickly be tattered with use. Every topic is introduced by a short paragraph; each numbered, illustrated step in the manufacturing process is then described in one sentence. Details are added in smaller print. The layout is sometimes confusing as the illustrated processes zigzag across the page or circle around the main picture.

She says that in each essay she is "conducting a three-pronged systemic analysis of race, sex and class from the perspective of African American women in the academy of religion." Her development begins with an historical detailing of what forged the black feminist consciousness. Cannon reveals how black women have found themselves to be moral agents in an African American tradition that combines both the "real-lived" texture of African American life and the oral-aural cultural tradition vital to African Americans. Cannon, the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. from Union Theological Seminary and the first to be ordained to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament in the United Presbyterian Church USA, a womanist philosopher and a theologian, deals mainly with canonical issues and "canon formation" as she calls for an inclusive rather than an exclusive frame of reference for governing life choices. Katie's Canon is both provocative and enlightening. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Cannon's (ethics and women's studies, Temple Univ.) pun-intentional canon is a compilation of previously published essays, papers, and articles. An eclectic mix of literary criticism, social commentary, liberation theology, and womanist ethics, this is more of a "best of" than a systematic theology; the author's canon represents her evolving analyses of the black female experience in its totality. She excels at unpacking the literary heritage of Zora Neale Hurston and the vitality of the black oral tradition. Cannon moves easily from the passion of folklore and legend to the conceptually rich but heavily academic language of ethics and womanist theology. Her role "is to speak as 'one of the canonical boys' and as the 'noncanonical other' at one and the same time." In this, she most assuredly succeeds.

The allegory the poet uses is that of earthly love, and the poems are strikingly effective on the immediate level of personal experience, quite apart from their theological meanings.</strong></p> Many critics regard the work of Saint John of the Cross (1542-91), the 16th-century mystic, to be among the finest poetry Spain has produced. This bilingual edition, the first in modern English, was originally published in hard cover in 1968 by the Indiana University Press. Most of these poems were written during a period of nine months, in 1577-78, when Saint John (San Juan de la Cruz) was imprisoned and tortured in the dungeon of a small Carmelite monastery in Toledo, and their recurrent motifs are both metaphysical and deeply personal.</p><p><p><strong>Willis Barnstone</strong>, professor, poet, and scholar, is the author of eighty volumes, including <em>The Restored New Testament</em>, <em>The Gnostic Bible</em>, <em>The Poems of Jesus Christ</em>, <em>The Poetics of Translation</em>, and <em>Mexico in My Heart: New and Selected Poems</em>.

He lives in Oakland, California, and Paris.</p></p><h2>The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine</h2><p><em>The Nature of Suffering</em> underscores the change that is taking place in medicine from a basic concern with disease to a greater focus on the sick person. Cassell centers his discussion on the problem of suffering because, he says, its recognition and relief are a test of the adequacy of any system of medicine. He describes what suffering is and its relationship to the sick person: bodies do not suffer, people do. An exclusive concern with scientific knowledge of the body and disease, therefore, impedes an understanding of suffering and diminishes the care of the suffering patient.<br> The growing criticism that medicine is not sufficiently humanistic does not go deep enough to provide a basis for a new understanding of medicine. New concepts in medicine must have their basis in its history and in the development of ideas about disease and treatment. Cassell uses many stories about patients to demonstrate that, despite the current dominance of science and technology, there can be no diagnosis, search for the cause of the patient's disease, prognostication, or treatment without consideration of the individual sick person. Recent trends in medicine and society, Cassell believes, show that it is time for the sick person to be not merely an important concern for physicians but the central focus of medicine. He addresses the exciting problems involved in such a shift. In this new medicine, doctors would have to know the person as well as they know the disease. What are persons, however, and how are doctors to comprehend them? The kinds of knowledge involved are varied, including values and aesthetics as well as science. In the process of knowing the experience of patient and doctor move to center stage. He believes that the exploration of the person will engage medicine in the 21st century just as understanding the body has occupied the last hundred years.</p><p><br><strong>Eric J.

The result of eighteen years of field research, <i>Shamanism and Tantra in the Himalayas</i> presents for the first time a comprehensive overview of shamanism that is based on the knowledge and experience of the different tribes from that region. Included are original statements from the various ethnic groups and 135 color thangkas, which act as visual guides to the specific practices of the tantric tradition. In addition to the thangkas, the book is lavishly illustrated with numerous photos of different shamanic healing ceremonies, ritual objects, and culturally significant plants that have never been published before. The book also contains a wealth of original recipes, smoking mixtures, scientific tables, charts, and descriptions of more than 20 plants whose psychoactive properties and uses by shamans have never before been researched or documented.</p><p>Claudia M�ller-Ebeling, Ph.D., is an art historian and anthropologist and coauthor, with Christian R�tsch, of <i>Shamanism and Tantra in the Himalayas</i>, <i>Witchcraft Medicine</i>, and <i>Pagan Christmas</i>.

He speaks 10 different languages and has a thorough knowledge of the Buddhist and Hindu religion and mythology and the cultural customs of the Newari people.The Way of the Shamans <br> <br> "The way of the shamans is the way of love." Despite all of their ethnic differences, Parvati Rai, Mohan Rai, Maile Lama, and Indra Gurung are united in this belief. As healers, they act in accordance with the ideal of transforming hate into love, jealousy into generosity, and ignorance into humility. With these three fundamental evils, which manifest as gnawing diseases, the shamans' magic number of three is encountered once again. Keep in mind that these three steps of diagnosis, therapy, and cure are merely an idealized progression. Because it is so easy to say (or write) but so difficult to fulfill, the shamans shall never become jobless and they must work for their lifetime on their own selves. They are only human. Jhankris become sick just like everyone else. They have burdens like we do, and fall as happily and as easily into their own traps. When they are in a trance, however, they are connected to a source of power which is only available in extreme situations in normal life. "When I cross the street I am afraid that I might be run over. But if I had fear of the dangers lurking in wait for me, I could not go into a trance," said Maile Lama with a laugh. <br> <br>The mission of bringing love, harmony, and peace to the hearts of patients who have been made sick by the gnawing poisons of hate, jealousy, and ignorance (regardless of whether it was generated in the breeding ground of the patient's own personality, or through poisoning by other people) cannot be fulfilled by someone who wears rose colored glasses. This assignment is no easy task. It requires the critical examination of uncomfortable truths, and necessitates encounters with dangerous adversaries. <br> <br>Many Jhankris are not capable of rising to the task. They escape into alcoholism or become "chicken shamans," or "professionals" in order to make their lives easier and to earn more money. A person who bluffs his way through as a "chicken shaman"--using sensational fire-eating displays, fantastical costumes, unnecessary animal sacrifices, and huge tom-toms--is not a Jhankri. Neither is the person who opens a practice with fixed office hours and a regular income. Again and again we heard from the Jhankris, who can swiftly see behind the fa�ade of their false colleagues, "Chicken shamans and 'professionals' are not shamans." This may seem odd to us. As members of western consumer societies, we might ask ourselves: why shouldn't a Jhankri make a profitable business from his abilities? Why shouldn't he or she open a regular practice like a doctor and earn money from it? The stunningly simple answer to our questions was, "Because we Jhankris are not permitted to advertise ourselves. We are only <i>dhami</i> Jhankris because others are healed by us, and not because we say that we can heal them." <br> <br>Only the person who can heal is a Jhankri. Every Jhankri is a <i>dhami</i>, a healer, but not every <i>dhami</i> is a Jhankri, because only a Jhankri falls into trance; a <i>dhami</i>, on the other hand, is not able to do so. <br> <br>No one in the Himalayas becomes a Jhankri because they choose it as their profession. One is called upon to become a Jhankri. Many go out of their way to avoid the calling because it will mean a difficult life of deprivation. Shamans are just ordinary humans. They are farmers, craftsmen, mothers, housewives, factory workers. And in addition to this, they shamanize when someone comes to them who needs their help. Many patients leave nothing behind for them other than a few words of thanks. Others bring a small bag of rice or leave behind 10 to 15 Rupees. <br> <br>Whenever we saw "our" Jhankris on the street, we always asked ourselves whether or not anybody realized that the plain woman wearing a traditional cotton sari and flip-flops, or the man with athletic pants, a shirt, and a baseball cap, was actually a powerful healer who battled demons at night and took on the nature and mannerisms of animal spirits. <br> <br>Just as the forces of nature rage, so too do the Jhankris often rage in their chintas (healing ceremonies). They call authoritatively for their helping spirits and then they send them away again when the trance is deep enough. The encounters with the forces beyond are reflected in their sweat-covered faces. They laugh or roll their eyes, roar or call out. No matter how deep the trance and how terrible the encounter is, no matter how ecstatically they convulse or spin in front of their altar, the Jhankris are always in the position to direct their journey through the three worlds and to control the trance. Often the diagnoses that they make while in the trance, bring back to the realm of normal consciousness, and announce to the patients are ruthless. We heard things such as, "There are hypocrites in your environment," or, " I have seen that you have often lied to your family." There is no trace of "gentle healing." The Jhankris take what their patients have carefully buried away, or repressed into their sub-consciousness, and lay it out on the table. <br> <br>At the same time, only what concerns the patient's current life is relevant to the diagnosis. For the person who has had a difficult childhood but is leading an overall happy life as an adult, the fears and anxieties do not resurface.</p><h2>Curious Writer, The, MLA Update, Brief Edition (5th Edition)</h2><p><i>For courses in First-Year Composition - Rhetoric.</i> <i> <i>This&nbsp;version&nbsp;of</i> </i> <i> <i>&nbsp;The Curious Writer, Brief Edition</i> </i> <i>&nbsp;has been updated to reflect the 8th Edition of the MLA Handbook&nbsp;(April 2016)*</i> <i> <br> </i> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Puts inquiry at the heart of good writing</b> </p> <p> <i>We write to learn as much as we do to express what we already know</i>.

Until now, however, there has been no sourcebook of primary texts that reveals the many varieties of Christian beliefs, practices, ethics, experiences, confrontations, and self-understandings. To help readers recognize and experience the rich diversity of the early Christian movement, <em>After the New Testament</em> provides a wide range of texts from the second and third centuries, both "orthodox" and "heterodox," including such works as the Apostolic Fathers, the writings of Nag Hammadi, early pseudepigrapha, martyrologies, anti-Jewish tractates, heresiologies, canon lists, church orders, liturgical texts, and theological treatises. Rather than providing only fragments of texts, this collection prints large excerpts--entire documents wherever possible--organized under social and historical rubrics. <br> This unique reader's concise and informative introductions and clear and up-to-date English translations make it ideal for courses on the New Testament, Christian Origins, Early Church History, or Late Antiquity. It will also be of interest to anyone--student, scholar, and general reader alike--interested in the entire range of early Christian literature from the period after the New Testament up to the writings of the so-called father of church history, Eusebius.</p><p>Bart D.

[this review takes up 2 fields;<br>see below for conclusion]<br><br>"Each chapter begins with a sketch of the important historical aspects of the topic, and each individual text is introduced with brief comments concerning its historical context and significance.

This reader is a welcome and needed addition to the increasing titles available on early Christianity, especially since it is not an anthology of secondary scholarly<br>opinion on the history of early Christianity, but provides the opportunity for students to become immersed in the primary sources themselves."--John Voelker, Marquette University, in the Journal of Early Christian Studies<br><br>"An outstanding collection of relevant primary sources for courses on the history of early Christianity.

The thematic approach is well thought out. A very useful text for a class on Christian origins."--Gaston Espinosa, Westmont College<br><br>"Ehrman's shrewd chapter topics, along with his brief (but pithy) introductions enable good use of these 2nd and 3rd century texts which together well represent the breadth and variety of Christian beginnings. We now have a fresh and student-friendly set of resources for examination of early<br>Christian literature 'after the New Testament.'"--Bob Gregg, Stanford University<br><br>"This is a splendid anthology that should replace several others that have been in use during the past decades. It should be of tremendous benefit to teachers and students of the New Testament and Early Christianity."--Elizabeth A. Clark, Duke University<br><br>"This volume will be invaluable to teachers of early Christian history who have lacked such a broad-ranging collection of key texts. It is likely to be sufficient in itself for a college or seminary introduction to early church history.

She is the recipient of many state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, and the Garden State Children's Choice Award. She lives in Great Neck, NY, and Wilmington, VT.<p>Johanna Hurwitz always knew she wanted to be a writer. She started by telling stories to her brother, who is six years her junior, and she's been making up stories ever since. Born and raised in New York City, she earned her B.A. degree from Queens College and went on to receive a master's in library science from Columbia University. She embarked on a career as a children's librarian, but she never forgot that one day she wanted to write books, too.</p><p>She worked at the New York Public Library and in a variety of other public and school library positions. She also taught graduate courses in children's literature and storytelling at Queens College. When she and her husband, Uri--a college teacher and writer-and their children, Nomi and Beni, moved to Long Island, she continued her library work.</p><p>Although she had told original stories to her children, it was not until they were well along in school that Mrs. Hurwitz actually began to write down her stories. That's why, when children ask her how long it takes to write a book, she replies that her first, <i>Busybody Nora</i>, took her whole life.</p><p>But since then she has been writing with regularity, portraying with humor and sympathy the everyday incidents that are so important to children. She is particularly fond of seven- to nine-year-olds, because they are " so very open and get excited about small things," and she enjoys writing realistic fiction for and about them.</p><p>That these youngsters are equally fond of Mrs. Hurwitz's books is obvious. She has received many child-chosen state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Wyoming Indian Paintbrush Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, the Garden State Children's Choice Award, the West Virginia Children's Book Award, and others.</p><p>In recent years, Johanna Hurwitz has crisscrossed the United States from Juneau, Alaska, to Jackson, Mississippi, and from San Diego, California, to St. Albans, Vermont. She has even spoken abroad, from Morocco to Mozambique and from Portugal to Nicaragua. On these trips she has met and spoken to schoolchildren, teachers, librarians, and parents. She has made many new friends and has often brought home new ideas for her next book.</p><p></p>Grade 3-4-Another winning story from Hurwitz. Adam Fine is excited when his parents hint that there will be a surprise waiting for him when he gets home from school. He decides it must be the new mountain bike he has been wanting, so he is amazed (and a little disappointed) to find that it's a llama. As Adam and his four-year-old sister get to know the strange creature (dubbed Ethan Allen by their mother), it becomes an important part of the family. Adam, however, still wants a new bike and spends most of his time figuring out how to get one. However, when he finds a valuable braided rug in the attic that he could sell, he trades it in order to get another llama to keep Ethan Allen company and to help his mother's growing business, "Fine Llama Treks" for tourists. Hurwitz has created a believable, likable protagonist. While Adam sees himself as a talented wheeler-dealer and is a typical 10-year-old in many respects, he's also wise and considerate. Satisfying in its depiction of a happy, secure Vermont family, this enjoyable tale would fit nicely into any library.<br><i> Jan Shepherd Ross, Dixie Elementary Magnet School, Lexington, KY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Man Without Qualities</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>ed SetRobert Musil was born in Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1880.

From the initial success of "yield management" in the commercial airline industry down to more recent successes of markdown management and dynamic pricing, the application of mathematical analysis to optimize pricing has become increasingly important across many different industries. But, since pricing and revenue optimization has involved the use of sophisticated mathematical techniques, the topic has remained largely inaccessible to students and the typical manager.<br><br>With methods proven in the courses taught by the author at Columbia and Stanford Business Schools as well as through his experience as founder of Nomis Solutions, this book presents the basic concepts of pricing and revenue optimization in a form accessible to MBA students, MS students, and advanced undergraduates.

In 1999, REFACTORING revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly-anticipated REFACTORING TO PATTERNS, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring. This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozed pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.</p><p><p>In 1994, "Design Patterns" changed the landscape of object-oriented development by introducing classic solutions to recurring design problems.

The first part presents maps, photos, illustrations, graphs, text, and recent statistics to help students learn about Earth and how humans have used and affected its resources. It provides a basic introduction to geography, and a variety of images to show how maps are made and how to read them. One chapter discusses the physical systems of the Earth, such as geological history, climate zones, vegetation, water availability, and environmentally vulnerable areas, and another on human systems examines world populations, cities, languages, religions, economies, food production, energy, and cultures. The second section, with one chapter for each continent, offers more traditional atlas coverage. Large maps depict physical and political features, climate, population distribution, and economic activity, and special "Focus On" features examine some aspect of the continent. Back matter includes basic statistics and an illustration of the flag for each nation and thematic and place-name indexes. The first section of the book, which provides easily understood information about geography and maps, is stronger than the second, which contains only general information about each continent and does not include highly detailed maps, but that basic introduction will nevertheless be valuable to many students.&#x2014;<i>Mary Mueller, Rolla Junior High School, MO</i> END</p><h2>The Craft of Tonal Counterpoint</h2><p>First Published in 2003.

Cringely reveals the manias and foibles of these men (they are always men) with deadpan hilarity and cogently demonstrates how their neuroses have shaped the computer business. But Cringely gives us much more than high-tech voyeurism and insider gossip. From the birth of the transistor to the mid-life crisis of the computer industry, he spins a sweeping, uniquely American saga of creativity and ego that is at once uproarious, shocking and inspiring. </p></p><p>Robert X. Cringely manages to capture the contradictions and everyday insanity of computer industry empire building, while at the same time chipping away sardonically at the PR campaigns that have built up some very common businesspeople into the household gods of geekdom. Despite some chuckles at the expense of all things nerdy, white, and male in the computer industry, Cringely somehow manages to balance the humor with a genuine appreciation of both the technical and strategic accomplishments of these industry luminaries. Whether you&#39;re a hard-boiled Silicon Valley marketing exec fishing for an IPO or just a plain old reader with an interest in business history and anecdotal storytelling, there&#39;s something to enjoy here.With a new afterword, this national bestseller by "the Liz Smith of Silicon Valley" (<i>Booklist</i>) divulges the quirkily brilliant tale of how--and why--the computer industry works.</p><h2>Transformative Learning: Educational Vision for the 21st Century</h2><p>With this powerful book, Edmund O'Sullivan aims to radically alter the role of education in building a sustainable future.

Based on over thirty years' medical practice, and study of the texts, this book explains the concepts involved so that the clinical applications of the ancient texts can be better understood and put into practice. The author looks at the larger context of ancient Chinese culture and philosophy in terms of theoretical knowledge, scholarly approach, and mindset in order to explain the basis for the medical texts. He also discusses the work of later Chinese medical scholars in elucidating the texts. He then goes on to look at more specific issues, such as the six conformations, zang-fu organ theory, the theory of qi and blood, the theory of qi transformation, and how these are understood in the ancient texts. He also discusses shao yang and tai yang theory; the element of time, and its place in understanding six conformations diseases.</p><p>This remarkable work of scholarship will clarify many questions about the interpretation of the ancient texts for modern use, and will find a place on the bookshelf of every practitioner of Chinese medicine, as well as on those of scholars of Chinese medicine.</p></p><p>Explanation and discussion of the theories underpinning the ancient Chinese medical textsGuohui Liu, M.Med., L.Ac., has been studying and practising Chinese medicine for over thirty years.

She has the occult wisdom of Isis, the eternal youth and beauty of Aphrodite, and the violent appetite of a lamia. Like A. Conan Doyle's <i>Lost World</i>, <i>She</i> is one of those magnificent Victorian yarns about an expedition to a far-off locale shadowed by magic, mystery, and death. <p> Tim Stout writes, in <i>Horror: 100 Best Books</i>, "As the plot takes hold one has the fancy that [Ayesha] had always existed, in some dark dimension of the imagination, and that [H. Rider] Haggard was the fortunate author to whom she chose to reveal herself." Haggard did, in fact, write this book in a six-week burst of feverish inspiration: "It came faster than my poor aching hand could set it down," he later said. </p><p> This edition of the 1887 classic features an introductory essay by literary critic Regina Barreca, who likens Ayesha to Flaubert's Madame Bovary or Tolstoy's Anna Karenina--"literally fantastic female figures who must be stopped before they love again."</p>First published in 1886-87, H. Rider Haggard&#x2019;s imperial romance follows its English heroes from the quiet rooms of Cambridge to the uncharted interior of Africa in search of a legendary lost city with an ageless white queen. The two men find their way to the ancient city of K�r, where the beautiful and mysterious Ayesha, &#x201c;She-who-must-be-obeyed,&#x201d; rules. Despite her cruelty, both men become fascinated by Ayesha, who leads them on a harrowing journey to bathe in the underground &#x201c;River of Life.&#x201d; A thrilling "history of adventure," She also reveals the complexity of Victorian attitudes towards race, gender, exploration, and empire. This Broadview edition presents the novel in its original illustrated Graphic magazine version, never before republished, and includes a critical introduction and supporting materials that demonstrate the novel's relationship to late-Victorian issues such as imperialism, archaeology, race, evolution, and the rise of the "New Woman."</p><h2>Pharmacy Technician Certification Quick-Study Guide (Apha Pharmacy Technician Training)</h2><p>The pharmacy technician occupation has changed tremendously since the 3rd edition of this book was released in 2006.

It did more than report on the contemporary scene-it was part of the action-and its preoccupations preoccupy us still: birth control, women&#39;s rights, civil liberties, and questions of social and economic justice. Mother Earth appeared without interruption until August 1917, when it was killed by wartime postal censorship. Though Emma Goldman has since become a legendary figure, scarcely any material from her magazine has remained in print. This Mother Earth reader sets right this great wrong, and restores to public memory an important body of work-provocative writings by Margaret Sanger, Alexander Kropotkin, and dozens of other radical thinkers of the early twentieth century.</p><p>Peter Glassgold&#39;s fiction, poetry, translations, essays, and reviews have appeared in such publications as Forward, The Nation, The New Leader, and Publishers Weekly. His most recent book, the novel Angel Max, was nominated for the 1998 America Award for Fiction. He lives in Brooklyn Heights, New York.Founded by Emma Goldman, Mother Earth magazine presented articles covering social, political, cultural, and historical issues from an anarchist perspective from 1906 to 1917, when it was stifled by wartime censorship. The journal also advocated action on such topics as women's rights, birth control, civil liberties, and social and economic justice. Glassgold (Angel Max) presents 95 articles, letters, poems, essays, stories, and other pieces from the journal. The articles are arranged in six sections covering anarchism, feminism, literature, civil liberties, social issues, and World War I and the Russian Revolution. Goldman, Max Baginski, Alexander Berkman, Margaret Sanger, Voltairine de Cleyre, Leo Tolstoy, and Eugene O'Neill are among the wide range of authors featured in this collection, which Glassgold opens with an excellent brief history of the publication. This anthology provides an exceptional presentation of early 20th-century anarchist ideas. For all academic and larger public library collections. Stephen L.

Bowen Series, 70)</h2><p><p>Many today do not recognize the word, but "philology" was for centuries nearly synonymous with humanistic intellectual life, encompassing not only the study of Greek and Roman literature and the Bible but also all other studies of language and literature, as well as history, culture, art, and more. In short, philology was the queen of the human sciences. How did it become little more than an archaic word?</p><p>In <i>Philology</i>, the first history of Western humanistic learning as a connected whole ever published in English, James Turner tells the fascinating, forgotten story of how the study of languages and texts led to the modern humanities and the modern university. The humanities today face a crisis of relevance, if not of meaning and purpose. Understanding their common origins&#x2015;and what they still share&#x2015;has never been more urgent.</p></p><p><p>"Finally, we have a careful study of the historical foundations in philology of most of the modern humanistic disciplines. Turner shows in detail how these disciplines--including art history, linguistics, religious studies, anthropology, classics, and literary scholarship--developed out of philology in a dynamic similar to that by which the physical sciences emerged out of natural philosophy and the social sciences out of moral philosophy."<b>--David A. Hollinger, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This very important and necessary book displays the qualities that have long marked James Turner's scholarship--deftness, wit, and clarity. This is a work whose humanity matches that of its subject."<b>--Michael O'Brien, University of Cambridge</b></p><p>"This fascinating book makes a powerful argument: that the modern humanities derived in large part from the broad tradition of philology. This genealogy, Turner shows, clarifies the origins of both the modern research university and its disciplines, and explains similarities between such apparently diverse fields as history and comparative religion. He offers a compelling account of the role that biblical studies played in the intellectual history of modern Britain and America, and he makes sense of the development of modern literary studies in a way that no historian has managed to before. This is a gripping intellectual detective story."<b>--Anthony Grafton, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Turner's exceptionally wide-ranging study shows in detail how Western culture has become, and has remained, distinctively philological."<b>--Tom Shippey</b></p><b>James Turner</b> is the Cavanaugh Professor of Humanities Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, where he taught in the History Department and the doctoral program in history and philosophy of science.</p><h2>Revolutionary France 1770-1880</h2><p><i></i> Revolutionary France is a vivid narrative history. It is also a radical reinterpretation of the period, and testimony to the power both of ideas and of personality in movements of the past.</p><p>This is an account of 110 years of turbulence and change. At the offset there were not one, but two revolutions: by intent the first was egalitarian, the second - Bonaparte's - authoritarian. The tension between the two characterized the period and shaped the Republic that in the end emerged from the ruins of the Ancien Regime. <br> <p><br> </p> <p>The narrative begins in the last years of Louis XVI. The author provides a graphic account of the years leading up to the Revolution and of the Revolution itself. The sovereignty of the people was as absolute as the monarchy it replaced, and the Terror was its tragic and inevitable consequence. In 1799, after a well planned and executed military coup, Bonaparte seized power and within five years had made himself France's first emperor. Napoleon conquered not only half of Europe but the aspirations of the Revolution, and put in place the laws and institutions by which France is still largely governed. Yet the Revolutionary ideology of liberty and equality survived Napoleon and two restorations of the monarchy, reemerging in the popular uprisings of 1830, 1848 and 1871, and finally finding constitutional expression in the Third Republic of 1871.<br> </p> <p><i>Revolutionary France</i> is a vivid narrative history.

Issues of trust are critical to solving problems as diverse as corporate responsibility, global warming, and the political system. In this insightful and entertaining book, Schneier weaves together ideas from across the social and biological sciences to explain how society induces trust. He shows the unique role of trust in facilitating and stabilizing human society. He discusses why and how trust has evolved, why it works the way it does, and the ways the information society is changing everything.</p><p><br><br> <b>Q&amp;A with Bruce Schneier, Author of <i>Liars and Outliers</i></b><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>Bruce Schneier, Author</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <b>In your book, <i>Liars and Outliers</i>, you write, "Trust and cooperation are the first problems we had to solve before we could become a social species--but in the 21st century, they have become the most important problems we need to solve again." What do you mean by trust?</b><br> That is the right question to ask, since there are many different definitions of trust floating around. The trust I am writing about isn't personal, it's societal. By my definition, when we trust a person, an institution, or a system, we trust they will behave as we expect them to. It's more consistency or predictability than intimacy. And if you think about it, this is exactly the sort of trust our complex society runs on. I trust airline pilots, hotel clerks, ATMs, restaurant kitchens, and the company that built the computer I'm writing these answers on.<br><br> <b>What makes people trustworthy?</b><br> That's the key question the book tackles. Most people are naturally trustworthy, but some are not. There are hotel clerks who will steal your credit card information. There are ATMs that have been hacked by criminals. Some restaurant kitchens serve tainted food. There was even an airline pilot who deliberately crashed his Boeing 767 into the Atlantic Ocean in 1999. Given that there are people who are naturally inclined to be untrustworthy, how does society keep their damage to a minimum? We use what I call societal pressures: morals and reputation are two, laws are another, and security systems are a fourth. Basically, it's all coercion. We coerce people into behaving in a trustworthy manner because society will fall apart if they don't.<br><br> <b>You introduce the idea of defectors--those who don't follow "the rules." What are defectors?</b><br> One of the central metaphors of the book is the Prisoner's Dilemma, which sets up the conflict between the interests of a group and the interests of individuals within the group. Cooperating--or acting in a trustworthy manner--sometimes means putting group interest ahead of individual interest. Defecting means acting in one's self-interest as opposed to the group interest. To put it in concrete terms: we are collectively better off if no one steals, but I am individually better off if I steal other people's stuff. But if everyone did that, society would collapse. So we need societal pressures to induce cooperation--to prevent people from stealing.<br><br> There are two basic types of defectors. In this example, the first are people who know stealing is wrong, but steal anyway. The second are people who believe that, in some circumstances, stealing is right. Think of Robin Hood, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. Or Jean Valjean from <i>Les Miserables</i>, who stole to feed his starving family.<br><br> <b>Why are some defectors good for society?</b><br> Cooperators are people who follow the formal or informal rules of society. Defectors are people who, for whatever reason, break the rules. That definition says nothing about the absolute morality of the society or its rules. When society is in the wrong, it's defectors who are in the vanguard for change. So it was defectors who helped escaped slaves in the antebellum American South. It's defectors who are agitating to overthrow repressive regimes in the Middle East. And it's defectors who are fueling the Occupy Wall Street movement. Without defectors, society stagnates.<br><br> <b>What major news stories of the past decade were triggered by failed trust? How can we prevent these failures in the future?</b><br> The story I had in most in mind while writing the book was the global financial crisis of a few years ago, where a handful of people cheated the system to their own advantage. Those were particularly newsworthy defectors; but if you start looking, you can see defectors and the effects of their defection everywhere: in corrupt politicians, special interests subverting the tax system, file sharers downloading music and movies without paying for them, and so on. The key characteristic is a situation where the group interest is in opposition to someone's self-interest, and people have been permitted to follow their own self-interest to the greater harm of the group.<br><br> <b>What makes <i>Liars and Outliers</i> so relevant in today's society?</b><br> As our systems--whether social systems like Facebook or political systems like Congress--get more complex, the destructive potential of defectors becomes greater. To use another term from the book, the scope of defection increases with more technology. This means that the societal pressures we traditionally put in place to limit defections no longer work, and we need to rethink security. It's easy to see this in terms of terrorism: one of the reasons terrorists are so scary today is that they can do more damage to society than the terrorists of 20 years ago could--and future technological developments will make the terrorists of 20 years from now scarier still.<br><br> <b>What do you hope readers will take away from reading <i>Liars and Outliers</i>?</b><br> I can do no better than quote from the first chapter: "This book represents my attempt to develop a full-fledged theory of coercion and how it enables compliance and trust within groups. My goal is to rephrase some of those questions and provide a new framework for analysis. I offer new perspectives, and a broader spectrum of what's possible. Perspectives frame thinking, and sometimes asking new questions is the catalyst to greater understanding. It&#x2019;s my hope that this book can give people an illuminating new framework with which to help understand the world."<br> <br><br><p><b>How does society function when you can't trusteveryone?</b></p><p>When we think about trust - we naturally think about personalrelationships or bank accounts.&nbsp; But that is much too narrow;trust is broader, and far more important.&nbsp; Nothing in societyworks without trust. It is the foundation of communities, commerce,democracy, and world stability.&nbsp;</p><p>In this insightful and entertaining book, Schneier weavestogether ideas from across the social and biological sciences toexplore how societies induce and encourage trust&#x2013;and whathappens when it fails in our personal lives, our businesses,communities, and the world.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s hyper-connected society, understanding themechanisms of trust is as important as understanding electricitywas a century ago.&nbsp; Issues of trust and security are criticalto solving problems as diverse as corporate responsibility, globalwarming, and stagnant political systems.&nbsp; After reading<i>Liars and Outliers</i>, you&#x2019;ll think about socialproblems, large and small, with a new perspective.</p><p>"Schneier makes an original and powerful argument for rethinkingsociety. . . .

With high stock and bond prices and the rising cost of housing, the post-subprime boom may well turn out to be another illustration of Shiller's influential argument that psychologically driven volatility is an inherent characteristic of all asset markets. In other words, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> is as relevant as ever. Previous editions covered the stock and housing markets&#x2015;and famously predicted their crashes. This edition expands its coverage to include the bond market, so that the book now addresses all of the major investment markets. It also includes updated data throughout, as well as Shiller's 2013 Nobel Prize lecture, which places the book in broader context. In addition to diagnosing the causes of asset bubbles, <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> recommends urgent policy changes to lessen their likelihood and severity&#x2015;and suggests ways that individuals can decrease their risk before the next bubble bursts.

In <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>, Marlowe deals with the gambling circuit, a murder he stumbles upon, and three very beautiful but potentially deadly women. In <i>The High Window</i>, Marlowe searches the California underworld for a priceless gold coin and finds himself deep in the tangled affairs of a dead coin collector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all three novels, Chandler&#x2019;s hard-edged prose, colorful characters, vivid vernacular, and, above all, his enigmatic loner of a hero, enduringly establish his claim not only to the heights of his chosen genre but to the pantheon of literary art.</p></p><p>Raymond Thornton Chandler (1888 - 1959) was the master practitioner of American hard-boiled crime fiction. Although he was born in Chicago, Chandler spent most of his boyhood and youth in England where he attended Dulwich College and later worked as a freelance journalist for <i>The Westminster Gazette</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>. During World War I, Chandler served in France with the First Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, transferring later to the Royal Flying Corps (R. A. F.). In 1919 he returned to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually became director of a number of independent oil companies. The Depression put an end to his career, and in 1933, at the age of forty-five, he turned to writing fiction, publishing his first stories in <i>Black Mask</i>. Chandler&#x2019;s detective stories often starred the brash but honorable Philip Marlowe (introduced in 1939 in his first novel,<b> The Big Sleep</b>) and were noted for their literate presentation and dead-on critical eye. Never a prolific writer, Chandler published only one collection of stories and seven novels in his lifetime. Some of Chandler&#x2019;s novels, like <b>The Big Sleep</b>, were made into classic movies which helped define the film noir style. In the last year of his life he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. He died in La Jolla, California on March 26, 1959.Raymond Chandler is often called the greatest of the American hard-boiled detective-story writers. His only rival would be his acquaintance Dashiell Hammett, six years his junior but finished with writing by the time Chandler, at the age of fifty, was beginning. Chandler was by heritage and education British, though he was born in Chicago in 1888, and his father was an American, a hard-drinking engineer for the railroads, whom he never saw again after his parents divorced. Without money, his Anglo-Irish Quaker mother decided to take the seven-year-old Raymond back to her home in Ireland, and then to London, where they were supported by an uncle who saw to it that he got a good English education in &#x2018;public&#x2019;, that is, private schools, most importantly Dulwich College, which also produced such other notable writers as C. S. Forester and P. G. Wodehouse. Here he became truly British, read the classics and played rugby like other English schoolboys. Though he showed an aptitude for writing, he expected to go into the law.<br><br>This was not to be. When Raymond was sixteen, the generous uncle thought he had supported his sister Florence and her son long enough. Raymond was obliged to leave Dulwich College, and so was thrust rather abruptly into a harsh real world for which he had little practical training, with the obligation to support his mother. First of all, however, he toured the Continent, like many young Englishmen before him, spending some time in Paris and in Germany to complete his education. He then returned to England to take a civil service examination, where he came in third of 800 candidates, and was given a job in the Admiralty. This did not last, nor did a term of teaching at his old school. The restless young man moved to Bloomsbury, then the heart of literary London, wrote book reviews, and tried living by his pen, not without success; but a boy of no private means needed a serious job. <br><br>When he was twenty-four, he decided to put his unpromising literary career behind him and embarked for America to make his fortune, trying a variety of jobs in a variety of places from the midwest to California, learning bookkeeping and stringing tennis rackets among others. As his biographer Tom Hiney says, &#x2018;There is no doubt that the character of Philip Marlowe was fleshed out in these resolute, if friendless and moneyless months in Californian boarding houses.&#x2019; But it would be some years before Chandler&#x2019;s great detective character Philip Marlowe saw the light of day. Chandler decided to settle permanently in Los Angeles, where he had landed a good job, and his mother came back to America to keep house for him. Unlike Dashiell Hammett, a Pinkerton detective, the more sheltered Chandler, with no real experience of crime and detection, worked as a business executive, and lived with his mother until he was over thirty-five.<br><br>The First World War was to change many things. Chandler joined the Canadian army, saying later that it felt more natural for him to wear a British uniform, and saw some action in Europe; it was in the trenches that he learned the details of blood and death that Marlowe would need to know. He was discharged in 1919 and, back in Los Angeles, planned to marry the love of his life, Cissy Pascal, a beautiful, twice-married woman seventeen years older than he, who pretended to be ten years younger than she was, and looked his own age. His mother, dying of cancer, opposed this peculiar marriage, so for a time Chandler, working as an executive in an oil company, supported both women in separate establishments. He and Cissy were married in 1924, after Florence&#x2019;s death, and they would be married, happily, it appeared, until she died more than thirty years later, when she was eighty-four and Chandler sixty-six. He would live only another four chaotic, troubled years.<br><br>By the end of the 1920s, a life-long problem, alcoholism, interrupted his career. Almost all the great American writers of the twenties and thirties were alcoholics &#x2014; Chandler, Hammett, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway &#x2014; and the valorization of drinking is a striking feature in the literature of the period. Hardly a page goes by without somebody taking a drink in <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>and <i>The Big Sleep. </i>This was almost certainly in part a result of Prohibition, which was repealed in 1933, but not before it had altered the behavior of the nation, giving it bootleggers and speakeasies, and institutionalized hypocrisy: everybody drank and law enforcement winked. Heavy use of alcohol was tolerated and even fashionable, somehow linked with the prevailing atmosphere of gaiety, wisecracking and crime. Susceptible people like Hammett and Chandler were caught in the paradox of a debilitating habit that would also furnish them with material. Another paradox: Chandler&#x2019;s worsening bouts of drunkenness would get him fired from his executive job but propelled him into writing, the career he had always wanted anyhow.<br><br>The shock of being fired was salutary. Post-Depression America was in a period of self-help and individual striving. Even matchbooks advertised writing schools and vocabulary improvement techniques for people hoping to emerge from the pack. Chandler was forty-four, without a job, and with a bad drinking problem, but he had always been, and known himself to be, a good writer. After leaving school in London, he had published some poems, and it was as a poet that he saw himself, but now he signed up for a course in short-story writing. He left Los Angeles and Cissy, sobered up with the help of some army buddies in Seattle, went back to L.A. and Cissy, and learned, methodically and with great determination, how to write fiction. He studied the work of Erle Stanley Gardner, Hemingway, and the stories in a pulp magazine of detective fiction, <i>Black Mask</i>, in which his first story was published at the end of 1933.<br><br>Between 1933 and 1938, when he sat down to write his first novel, Chandler had written twenty-one <i>Black Mask </i>stories in which, under the guidance of its famous editor, Joseph Shaw, he polished the distinctive qualities of his later fiction. Here were the Marlowe prototypes, bad cops and good cops, Los Angeles and Bay City (Santa Monica) settings, the formula subjects of crime, sex, sadism and alcohol, a Chandleresque commitment to vivid minor characters, occasional passages of fine writing that hinted at his secret literary tastes, and a characteristic tone that hovers on the edge of satire. It is perhaps this tone that Ross Macdonald refers to when he says of Chandler that &#x2018;he writes like a slumming angel&#x2019; &#x2014; not quite the unmodified compliment it is sometimes taken for. One suspects that Chandler&#x2019;s Englishness accounts for the slightly patronizing detachment in Marlowe&#x2019;s tone when he describes the Los Angeles and Bay City underside, with its colorful new-world characters and rough manners. Capturing the American self-image, tough and self-deprecating, he also reflects a British impression of America, as a visitor struck by its brash color and the special cadence of the American language.<br><br>It is in <i>The Big Sleep </i>that he introduces his great creation, Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is partly generic hero &#x2014; the high-principled loner characteristic of both cowboy and detective genres &#x2014; and partly alter-ego, embodying Chandler&#x2019;s real attitudes and idealized projections of himself as a tough private detective, irresistible to women. Marlowe is an alcoholic bachelor from California, an idealistic, misogynist and generally misanthropic ex-cop who despises women and yet retains a gentlemanly, protective feeling about them. Judging from the enthusiasm of the women he meets, he&#x2019;s good-looking, &#x2018;six feet of iron man [Chandler was just under six feet], one-ninety pounds stripped and with [his] face washed&#x2019;. But like the cowboy heroes of the era, he almost always turns down female advances, which have only served to confirm his low impression of the morality of women in general. He has traces of chivalry &#x2014; when he has to belabor old Mrs Morrison verbally, he feels bad about it: &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like being rough with old ladies &#x2014; even if they are lying gossips.&#x2019; He goes out of his way to help Merle Davis and other nice girls. For himself, he prefers &#x2018;smooth, shiny girls, hard-boiled and loaded with sin&#x2019;, to nice girls, and most of the women he meets belong to the first category. He&#x2019;s tender-hearted enough to rescue a struggling beetle, and carefully carries it out of a high-rise to place it on a bush. He gets scared, has a sense of humor and of history, and sometimes indulges himself in flowery riffs of language: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid of death and despair . . . of dark water and drowned men&#x2019;s faces and skulls with empty eye sockets. I&#x2019;m afraid of dying, of being nothing, of not finding a man named Brunette.&#x2019;<br><br>For a tough guy, he is also slightly hapless. He&#x2019;s not particularly lucky, is often caught off guard, is strangled, drugged and sapped. It may be revealing that Chandler himself wanted the comic actor Cary Grant to play the part of Marlowe in the movies, though he was delighted with Humphrey Bogart too. What is appealing about Marlowe is his rueful self-questioning, his ability to say that he&#x2019;s wrong or a chump. His life, lonesome and underpaid, has a dignity which he is careful to preserve. He throws Carmen Sternwood<br>out of his room after she&#x2019;s showed up naked and called him a &#x2018;filthy name&#x2019; when he won&#x2019;t sleep with her: &#x2018;this was the room I had to live in. It was all I had in the way of a home. In it was everything that was mine, that had any association for me, any past, anything that took the place of a family. Not much; a few books, pictures, radio, chessmen . . .&#x2019; <br><br>There are obvious sources in Chandler&#x2019;s own experience of several situations in <i>The Big Sleep</i>. Like Carmen Sternwood, Cissy had posed in the nude when young. She had also taken opium, though hardly to the extent of the pathological Carmen. Marlowe&#x2019;s alcohol problems mirrored Chandler&#x2019;s own, though when writing these three novels, he was still on the wagon (he would fall off when he went to Hollywood in 1943). Not that Marlowe considers that he has a problem, though he often regrets in the morning having taken that last drink, and his lurid dreams can resemble DTs: &#x2018;I was a pink-headed bug crawling up the side of the City Hall.&#x2019; Chandler when drinking had both blackouts and DTs, and would eventually be hospitalized for alcohol-related health and mental ailments.<br><br><i>The Big Sleep</i>, greatly admired by the perceptive publisher Alfred A Knopf, who had also brought out Hammett and James M. Cain (<i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>), was not taken seriously by critics, and sold fewer than thirteen thousand copies. People who did read it were often taken aback by the depiction of general depravity &#x2014; porn pictures, dope, nymphomania, gambling, obsessions, rackets and crime rings, and the mention of unmentionables &#x2014; the &#x2018;pouched ring of pale rubber&#x2019; among the litter in a slum, for instance &#x2014; though for modern readers, it is Marlowe&#x2019;s coolly equable tone about all this that constitutes the novel&#x2019;s charm. It would only come into its own after the film version with Humphrey Bogart appeared in 1946, though it was also published successfully in France and England.<br><br>His second novel, <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i>, published in May 1940, fared little better, but Chandler had begun to develop a following, including such fellow writers as Erle Stanley Gardner and S. J. Perelman. <i>Farewell, My Lovely </i>is an advance over even the very fine <i>Big Sleep</i>. The plot is similarly picaresque, with a similar double-twist ending, but here Chandler has Marlowe more firmly in control. Marlowe&#x2019;s qualities are also more confidently rendered: his rapid assessments of other characters, his idiosyncrasies &#x2014; putting on his pajamas and going to bed when he&#x2019;s expecting both the villain Malloy, and a lady &#x2014; his drinking habits, his sudden moods of liking or compassion for a down-and-out informer or minor thug, his innate fastidiousness, and above all a certain generosity of spirit, even trustfulness, beneath the surface cynicism, qualities that must have been a lot like Chandler&#x2019;s own.<br><br>His critical reputation continued to outpace his sales and readership. He rose to cult status in England following praise of his work by W. H. Auden and Somerset Maugham, and American critics eventually followed suit. One definition of art demands that the effort of the artist be somehow apparent, not in the sense of strain but of loving effort lavished on his medium, &#x2018;pains&#x2019;, as one critic called it, and it was this quality that attracted Edmund Wilson, who excepted Chandler from his general condemnation of detective stories. Chandler himself considered his writing to be art and wanted to make sure no one missed that &#x2014; he included in his books both literary observations, as when Marlowe recognizes the source of the cocker spaniel Heathcliffe&#x2019;s name or alludes to Pepys&#x2019;s diaries, and just enough fancy writing to make the point. Despite his little barbs at modernist writers (he describes Hemingway as &#x2018;a guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good&#x2019;), he shares many of the same almost Deco aesthetic qualities of hard-edged stylization.<br><br>Chandler has nearly limitless powers of description, whether full-dress, as in his long portraits of the Sternwoods in <i>The Big Sleep</i>, or in his jewel-like little pictures of any minor character: &#x2018;a sloe-eyed lad in a blue mess jacket with bright buttons, a bright smile and a gangster mouth, handed the girls up from the taxi&#x2019;, or a clerk who has a &#x2018;washed-out blue smock, was thin on top as to hair, had fairly honest eyes and his chin would never hit a wall before he saw it&#x2019;. Sometimes he tosses off a casual simile &#x2014; &#x2018;Her eyes became narrow and almost black and as shallow as enamel on a cafeteria tray&#x2019; &#x2014; and sometimes contents himself with an offhand phrase: someone is &#x2018;drunker than a legion convention&#x2019;, another character is &#x2018;a ruthless permanent&#x2019;. He never fails to render vivid, almost indelible, the least members of his panoply of sexy, predatory women, cops and underworld characters. <br><br>A modern, politically correct reader will be struck by the absolute lack of political correctness in Marlowe&#x2019;s world, and perhaps be startled by the embarrassingly crude ethnic and gender slurs. We have dinges and shines, dames and tramps, limp-wristed male cuties, &#x2018;short, dirty wops&#x2019;, &#x2018;greasy sensual Jews&#x2019;, and &#x2018;almost clean&#x2019; Chinamen. The explanation for the language lies, no doubt, in verisimilitude; Marlowe and Chandler lived in a competitive, dangerous, and not overly polite post-Depression world. At best, it conveys Chandler&#x2019;s relish for vernacular speech, and especially American speech, in which he found a colorful pungency absent from the polite diction of Dulwich. But it also depicts an unusually hostile city of armed people ready to pull knives or take a swing at<br>Marlowe unprovoked; whether that was the reality of the time, a reflex of Chandler&#x2019;s own world view, or an Englishman&#x2019;s appalled perception of a tough frontier, is not always clear. <br><br>Some critics have found <i>The High Window</i>, Chandler&#x2019;s third Marlowe novel, which he struggled to write over the next two years, a falling off from the first two. It is true that in the beginning of the book, the wisecracking Marlowe is irritatingly elliptical, the chip on his shoulder almost insurmountably present. Perhaps that was a result of Chandler&#x2019;s fatigue and growing restlessness, but the effect is to intensify the reader&#x2019;s impression of Marlowe&#x2019;s alienation and inner despair, qualities that serve to elevate him even farther above the cohort of tough detectives from which he sprang. The plot &#x2014; Marlowe is hired to find a valuable coin &#x2014; is as clever as usual, and infinitely c...</p><h2>Living with Darwin: Evolution, Design, and the Future of Faith (Philosophy in Action)</h2><p>Charles Darwin has been at the center of white-hot public debate for more than a century. In <em>Living With Darwin</em>, Philip Kitcher stokes the flames swirling around Darwin's theory, sifting through the scientific evidence for evolution, Creation Science, and Intelligent Design, and revealing why evolution has been the object of such vehement attack. Kitcher first provides valuable perspective on the present controversy, describing the many puzzles that blocked evolution's acceptance in the early years, and explaining how scientific research eventually found the answers to these conundrums. Interestingly, Kitcher shows that many of these early questions have been resurrected in recent years by proponents of Intelligent Design. In fact, Darwin himself considered the issue of intelligent design, and amassed a mountain of evidence that effectively refuted the idea. Kitcher argues that the problem with Intelligent Design isn't that it's "not science," as many critics say, but that it's "dead science," raising questions long resolved by scientists. But Kitcher points out that it is also important to recognize the cost of Darwin's success--the price of "life with Darwin." Darwinism has a profound effect on our understanding of our place in the universe, on our religious beliefs and aspirations. It is in truth the focal point of a larger clash between religious faith and modern science. Unless we can resolve this larger issue, the war over evolution will go on.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Kitcher</strong> is the John Dewey Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.

Andersen's most beloved tales, such as "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Ugly Duckling," and "The Little Mermaid," are now joined by "The Shadow" and "Story of a Mother," mature stories that reveal his literary range and depth. Tatar captures the tales' unrivaled dramatic and visual power, showing exactly how Andersen became one of the world's ten most translated authors, along with Shakespeare, Dickens, and Marx. Lushly illustrated with more than one hundred fifty rare images, many in full color, by artists such as Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac, <em>The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen</em> will captivate readers with annotations that explore the rich social and cultural dimensions of the nineteenth century and construct a compelling portrait of a writer whose stories still fascinate us today.</p><p><p><strong>Hans Christian Andersen</strong> (1805-1875), famous Danish author and poet, is beloved by children and adults the world around for his famous children's stories such as "The Steadfast Tin Soldier," "The Snow Queen," "The Little Mermaid," "Thumbelina," "The Little Match Girl," The Ugly Duckling," "The Emperor's New Clothes," and "The Princess and the Pea," among many others.</p><p><strong>Maria Tatar</strong> chairs the Program in Folklore and Mythology at Harvard University.

She is co-translator of <i>The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen</i>, with Maria Tatar.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Andersen, creator of The Princess and the Pea and The Ugly Duckling, receives treasury treatment in this latest entry in Norton's series of annotated classics, replete with margin notes attentive to historical contexts, critical interpretations and folkloric influences. Tatar, Harvard's dean for humanities (<i>The Annotated Brothers Grimm</i>), relates that when she taught Andersen's tales, undergraduates often reported their magical childhood experiences with the fairy tales and protested her analyses of Andersen's frequently brutal scenarios. Tatar avers that her research did help her re-evaluate the affective qualities of Andersen's work. While it remains important to acknowledge the sadism of renowned tales like The Snow Queen and The Little Match Girl, and to investigate Andersen's bitter efforts to join fashionable Danish society (noted in a biographical appendix), this collection of 12 Tales for Children and a dozen more Tales for Adults focuses on the stories' fairy tale references and aesthetic appeal. Gorgeous turn-of-the-century illustrations by Kay Nielsen, William Heath Robinson and others and a section with comments from Dickens, van Gogh and Ursula Le Guin, among others testify to Andersen's wide influence. Translating with Julie K.

While emphasising the liveliness of the play in stage terms, David Crane also claims that this citizen comedy needs to be taken much more seriously than in the past, as an expression of Shakespeare&#39;s fundamental understanding of human life, conveyed centrally in the character of Falstaff. In the process he also examines Shakespeare&#39; free and vigorous use of different linguistic worlds within the play.According to legend, Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted with the character of Sir John Falstaff in <i>Henry IV,</i> Parts I and II, that she commanded Shakespeare to create a romantic comedy depicting the jolly old rogue in love. The obedient playwright responded with <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor,</i> a lively and enduring farce that offers a humorous rebuff to lechery and hypocrisy. <br>Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth.

Through his &#34;Lives of Sparta&#39;s leaders&#34; and his recording of memorable &#34;Spartan Sayings&#34;, he depicts a people who lived frugally and mastered their emotions in all aspects of life, who also disposed of unhealthy babies in a deep chasm, introduced a gruelling regime of military training for boys, and treated their serfs brutally. Rich in anecdote and detail, Plutarch&#39;s writing brings to life the personalities and achievements of Sparta with unparalleled flair and humanity.</p><p><b>Plutarch</b>&nbsp;(c.50-c.120 AD) was a writer and thinker born into a wealthy, established family of Chaeronea in central Greece. He received the best possible education in rhetoric and philosophy, and traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. Later, a series of visits to Rome and Italy contributed to his fame, which was given official recognition by the emperors Trajan and Hadrian. Plutarch rendered conscientious service to his province and city (where he continued to live), as well as holding a priesthood at nearby Delphi. His voluminous surviving writings are broadly divided into the "moral"works and the&nbsp;<i>Parallel Lives</i>&nbsp;of outstanding Greek and Roman leaders. The former (<i>Moralia</i>) are a mixture of rhetorical and antiquarian pieces, together with technical and moral philosophy (sometimes in dialogue form).&nbsp;<i>The Lives</i>&nbsp;have been influential from the Renaissance onwards.<br><br><b>Richard Talbert</b> was born in England in 1947. He was a scholar of The King&#x2019;s School, Canterbury, and of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he gained a Double First Class Honors in Classics, followed by a doctorate which was the basis of his first book, <i>Timoleon and the Revival of Greek Sicily</i>. After his appointment in 1970 to teach ancient history at Queen&#x2019;s University, Belfast, his research extended into Roman history and the production of his major work, <i>The Senate of Imperial Rome</i>, which won the Goodwin Award of Merit.

We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A &amp; P. Although workers may not have been political in traditional terms during the '20s, as they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance. As the depression worsened in the 1930s, not only did workers find their pay and working hours cut or eliminated, but the survival strategies they had developed during the 1920s were undermined. Looking elsewhere for help, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences as citizens, ethnics and blacks, wage earners and consumers all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists. First printed in 1990, Making a New Deal has become an established classic in American History. The second edition includes a new introductory essay by Lizabeth Cohen.</p><p>This book examines what it meant for ordinary factory workers to become effective unionists and national political participants by the mid-1930s.

He volunteered for ambulance service in Italy, was wounded and twice decorated. Out of his experience came A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway&#39;s description of war is unforgettable. He recreates the fear, the comradeship, the courage of his young American volunteer, and the men and women he meets in Italy, with total conviction. But A Farewell to Arms is not only a novel of war. In it Hemingway has also created a love story of immense drama and uncompromising passion.</p><p>As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc� of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits: <blockquote> I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know. </blockquote> The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he "did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards." Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine. <p> Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, like his other novels (<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, and <i>To Have and Have Not</i>), offers neither. What it <i>does</i> provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Theory of Knowledge: A Thematic Introduction (American History)</h2><p><em>The Theory of Knowledge: A Thematic Introduction</em> explains the main ideas and problems of contemporary epistemology while avoiding technical detail. Comprehensive and rich in illustrations and examples, it highlights contemporary debates over the definition, sources, and limits of human knowledge, and covers major topics including the nature of belief, theories of truth, epistemic justification, the Gettier problem, skepticism, and epistemic rationality. Its discussions identify important connections between traditional epistemological questions and cognitive science, the history of science, the sociology of knowledge, and cross-cultural studies. <br> The book culminates with a focus on questions regarding epistemological method and an examination of the roots of contemporary analytic approaches to epistemology. The authors defend a distinctive position regarding epistemological method, called broad explanationism, that incorporates some insights from naturalism in epistemology. The volume is enhanced by a glossary of important epistemological terms and suggestions for further reading. Easily accessible to beginning students in philosophy, <em>The Theory of Knowledge</em> serves as an ideal text for courses in the theory of knowledge and will also appeal to general readers interested in philosophy.<br></p><p>Paul K.

Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium.

As a fiftieth birthday present, I taught myself steel.<br><br>I love all of it.<br><br>By junior high we had moved to the West Coast and I was earning spending dough teaching other kids to play guitar and gigging in a bar -mitzvah/wedding combo, doubling on bass&#x2013;not with a real bass; I turned down the tone control on my amp and faked.<br><br>My instrument of necessity was a cheapo Japanese electric solidbody that viewed staying in tune as a joke. The tone it produced ranged from tinny to <i>really</i> tinny. Finally, in 1965, I saved enough cash to buy a better tool. A hundred and twenty-one dollars barely got me a &#x2019;62 Gibson Melody Maker at Wallach&#x2019;s Music City, on the northwest corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood. Thirty dollars more would&#x2019;ve earned a Les Paul.<br><br>I schlepped my new acquisition home on the bus and gigged with it for years. It produced cool sound and the whammy bar was fun, but someone must&#x2019;ve hexed the wiring; the damn thing would shock me at inopportune intervals. For acoustic noise, my old Gibson archtop continued to suffice. (I&#x2019;ve held on to that one, after foolishly having it gussied up and refinished to sunburst during the seventies.)<br><br>Married at twenty-two, equipped with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at twenty-four, I began working with pediatric cancer patients at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. High--stress days on the wards endowed nighttime guitar playing with new meaning. I taught myself jazz chords, finger-picking, and bluegrass ditties. I began saving up for a tuneful instrument and lucked out in 1975, when my supervisor offered me a never--played five-year-old Martin D-28 for the $325 it had cost him.<br><br>Over the next decade, I fathered children, treated patients, trained physicians and psychologists, conducted research on behavioral medicine, and wrote two books on psychology. Evenings were spent augmenting my med school professor&#x2019;s salary with private practice. The quiet hours between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. were spent in an unfinished garage, writing fiction no one wanted to publish.<br><br>My wife, eerily prescient, had convinced me to buy a house in 1974, just before the California real estate boom, so we were in better shape than most of our friends. I began setting aside cash for a <i>really </i>great guitar.<br><br>In 1978, I bought a D&#x2019;Angelico New Yorker for eighteen hundred dollars and learned about a whole new level of sound.<br><br>The following year, I bought a Stromberg Deluxe for eight hundred dollars and a Brazilian rosewood Martin D--35 for not much more. The year after that, a truly spectacular Stromberg Master 400 came my way for two grand. A 1924 Lloyd Loar&#x2014;-signed L--5 was offered for the staggering sum of four thousand dollars and I declined. But my wife bought it for me.<br><br>Those prices, ludicrous by today&#x2019;s standards, strained our budget. Faye, a skilled musician herself, was content to play one mandolin, but she never held me back. Quite the contrary; as guitars began soaring in value, it was my brilliant, beautiful spouse, <i>eerily</i> prescient, who encouraged me to trade up before all the good stuff was out of reach.<br><br>I began buying, selling, trading, and poring over instrument lists mailed out by vintage guitar dealers&#x2013;a relatively nascent profession at the time.<br><br>I studied want -ads and used my lunch hour at the hospital to track down interesting-sounding items. Ignorance, confusion, and flat--out larceny prevailed, and most of those detective jaunts ended in futility. But once in a while I struck gold.<br><br>A hippie living in a Hollywood crash pad sold me his &#x2019;34 Gibson L--5, housed in a battered leather case festooned with international travel stickers, because he was going to meditate full--time and no longer needed "help."<br><br>A prosperous Mexican--American businessman brought his late father&#x2019;s glorious dead--mint 1940 Epiphone Emperor to my private office waiting room after hours, accepted my check with tears in his eyes, and told me he was happy someone would be playing it again.<br><br>A stooped, half--blind, ninety-year-old man yanked open the creaky door to the spare bedroom of his mid-city apartment and revealed a ceiling--high mountain of instrument cases&#x2013;trumpets, tubas, xylophones, zithers, violins, double -basses. Mostly junk, but there was that pearloid--decorated Vega archtop.<br><br>A junket to a dusty, chain--linked, pit--bull--guarded trailer in an ominous section of Sunland introduced me to a huge mustachioed man who styled himself "the Assyrian Elvis." He sold me his 1937 Gibson Super 400 because he needed something flashier for his Vegas debut. I played that one for a couple of years, found it lacking in volume, and traded it, plus cash, for another D&#x2019;Angelico.<br><br>Guitar prices began soaring to inconceivable levels. My New Yorker was exchanged for a better--sounding version of the same model, now worth five thousand dollars.<br><br>Then ten.<br><br>Then twenty. And rising...<br><br>In 1985, I published my first novel, <i>When the Bough Breaks</i>. The advance payment amounted to three bucks an hour. My main gig was seeing patients, so this was found money, right?<br><br>I spent it on a guitar.<br><br>To everyone&#x2019;s surprise&#x2013;most of all my publisher&#x2013;the book became a best-seller.<br><br>Hmm...<br><br>I won&#x2019;t insult your intelligence by claiming I never intended to build a collection, because you don&#x2019;t just happen to end up with 120 guitars. But amassing and hoarding were never my primary motivations. For the past thirty-five years, I&#x2019;ve been chasing fabulous sound. And since the guitar produces a more varied sound than any other instrument, the quest has led me to <i>lots</i> of guitars.<br><br>The collector&#x2019;s disease may be a variant of obsessive--compulsive disorder. It may also be rooted in gender: When women collect, the object of desire is often rational and utilitarian&#x2013;something worn, used for adornment, taken out in public. Jewelry. Designer purses. Vintage clothing. The stuff that sits on shelves or in cases or hides in albums and drawers&#x2013;coins, stamps, matchbooks, toy soldiers, watches, Faberg&#x17d; eggs, beer cans, paperclips&#x2013;tends to be acquired by males. And being a manly sort...<br><br>Enough cheap rationalization. I can&#x2019;t explain the reasoning behind what you&#x2019;re going to view in this book with any sense of logic, though I&#x2019;ve always acquired with forethought and clear intention. And a desire to learn.<br><br>The process of acquiring has involved a huge amount of self--education, allowing me to indulge another passion: research. The same fascination for details&#x2013;okay, minutiae&#x2013;that I indulge each time I sit down to write a new novel comes to play when I enter new areas of guitar history. Collecting guitars has taught me volumes about music, psychology, ethnography, acoustical physics, culture. And the monumental impact of the guitar upon all that.<br><br>Most important, my instruments sound great and I love playing them. I hope you enjoy viewing them.<br><br>Jonathan Kellerman</p><h2>We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People (American Empire Project)</h2><p><b>From a State Department insider, the first account of our blundering efforts to rebuild Iraq--a shocking and rollicking true-life tale of Americans abroad</b><br> Charged with rebuilding Iraq, would you spend taxpayer money on a sports mural in Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhood to promote reconciliation through art?

Fustel de Coulanges' 1864 masterpiece, <i>La Cit� antique,</i> drew upon physical evidence as well as ancient documents rather than the usual post-Classical histories. The result is a fresh, accurate, and detailed portrait of the religious, family, and civic life of Periclean Athens and Rome during the time of Cicero.<br>This fascinating sociological account reveals the significance of kinship and the cult of the family hearth and ancestors to ancient Hellenic and Latin urban culture. It chronicles the rise of family-centered pagan belief systems, tracing their gradual decline to the spread of Christianity.

The volume is thoroughly introduced in the General Introduction and Part Introductions and each piece is contextualized within the wider sphere of global theory. Each&nbsp;part also includes annotated suggestions for further reading to help the reader navigate the extensive literature on each topic.The volume engages with the "internationalizing" of the curriculum as well as the globalization of literature and theory.</p> <p>Alongside these key themes, the volume also extends its coverage to include:</p> <ul> <li>The core topics and theorists from formalism and structuralism to postmodernism and deconstruction</li> <li>Digital humanities and humanities computing and their relevance to globalization and literary theory</li> <li>The religious turn in literary theory and philosophy</li> <li>New textualities such as auto/biography, travel writing and ecocriticism</li> <li>Oppositional texts which "write back" against the canon </li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>In addition, the book&#x2019;s <strong>Companion Website</strong> features an interactive world map incorporating biographies of every theorist in the book, as well as biographies of additional influential theorists. </p> <p></p> <p>Crucially, this anthology shows that ethnic, postcolonial studies and globalization are not simply niche areas of literary study but are of concern across the contemporary humanities and that new voices are always emerging, and being discovered, from around the globe. As such, this volume offers a refocusing of essential literary theory, extending the canon in line with ongoing debates concerning contemporary cultural and geographic borders.</p></p><p><p><strong>Richard J. Lane</strong> is a professor of English at Vancouver Island University, Canada, where he is the Director of The Literary Theory Research Group and the Seminar for Advanced Studies in the Humanities. He has written several books and articles on literary theory and has experience of teaching and presenting on literary theory at universities across the US, Canada and the UK.</p><p><strong>"This timely and path-breaking anthology makes it irresponsible not to study critical and literary theories in a global context."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Alexander C. Y. Huang, Recipient of the MLA Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies</i></p> <p><strong>"This substantive and significant collection of literary theory brings together a wealth of a really important critical material from around the world, including but also going beyond writers who have defined the field within the Western Academy. As a result, its carefully chosen and lucidly introduced extracts provide students with an exciting and accessible way into key conceptual, political and aesthetic questions and debates concerning the study of literature and culture in a global context. <i>Global Literary Theory</i> is a rich, stimulating and timely anthology, ideally positioned to help frame and shape how we engage with literary studies in the twenty-first century."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Dr Paul Young, University of Exeter, UK</i></p> <p><strong>"In a crowded and competitive field, Richard Lane&#x2019;s anthology sets itself apart from the rest by living up to its title. This is a truly global survey of theory past and present, as comprehensive, judicious and up-to-the-minute as anyone could wish for. It promises to be an indispensable field-guide to the multiform complexities of theory for many years to come."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Dr Paul Sheehan, Macquarie University, Australia</i></p> <p><strong>"Responding to our rapidly changing, globalised planet, this groundbreaking anthology fulfils three crucial tasks for students and teachers. It begins to help us understand different world traditions of literary interpretation; it introduces new theories and problems for reading literature internationally; and it will start to establish a properly global literary studies."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Professor Robert Eaglestone, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK</i></p> <p><strong>"<em>Global Literary Theory</em> takes its promise of global coverage seriously; the anthology covers the now canonical figures of literary theory and brings them into useful and often challenging dialogue with newer voices from around the world. But this is not to say that the concept of the global gets a free pass; the valuable section on discourses of globalization, when read alongside the original selections of material on postcolonialism and race (these selections ranging from a reading of the influence of the internet in China to postmodern constructions of Islam), mean that the anthology itself practices the critical awareness it seeks to promote in students."</strong>&nbsp; <em>Dr Christopher Pittard, University of Portsmouth, UK</em></p> <p><strong>"<em>Global Literary Theory</em> is an important resource for those teaching literary criticism and cultural theory. With clear prose and well-written section introductions contextualizing the extracts, the anthology provides a complete overview of theoretical fields while also situating the essays in relationship to each other across the global conversation. The result of Lane&#x2019;s arrangement is that readers are aware not just of the important essays from key theoretical movements, but are also aware of how these essays address each other and the exigencies of a global sensibility. The Further Reading recommendations that appear at the end of each section make the text familiar to those versed in literary theory and approachable for those who are not. With a study of the framework of humanism at its core, the anthology encourages readers to examine what Lane calls "re-constituted" theory through a global lens. This is a valuable anthology for those looking to revisit the traditional views of literary theory from a global perspective."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Dr Corinna McLeod, Grand Valley State University, USA</i></p> <p><strong>"<em>Global Literary Theory: An Anthology</em> is a dynamic and illuminating synthesis of the fast moving and diverse field of literary theory. It introduces and subtly contextualizes a wide range of theoretical approaches from Russian formalism to postcolonialism, queer theory and globalization theory while never losing sight of their historical matrix and ongoing dialogue. We are reminded for example that the collapse of English literature's 'civilizing mission' was the catalyst for literary studies replenishment by a variety of transformative and politicized theoretical approaches and that Derridean deconstruction cannot be thought in isolation from his liminal Algerian heritage. Much more than a synopsis, <i>Global Literary Theory</i> is a superb intervention into the ongoing transnational conversation that constitutes contemporary literary theory."</strong>&nbsp; <i>Dr Ned Curthoys, Australian National University, Australia</i></p></p><h2>Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 1: 1913-1926</h2><p>Walter Benjamin was one of the most original and important critical voices of the twentieth century, but until now only a few of his writings have been available in English. Harvard University Press has now undertaken to publish a significant portion of his work in definitive translation, under the general editorship of Michael W. Jennings. This volume, the first of three, will at last give readers of English a true sense of the man and the many facets of his thought. (The <i>magnum opus</i> of Benjamin&#x2019;s Paris years, <i>The Arcades Project</i>, has been published in a separate volume.) Walter Benjamin emerged from the head-on collision of an idealistic youth movement and the First World War, which Benjamin and his close friends thought immoral. He walked away from the wreck scarred yet determined &#x201c;to be considered as the principal critic of German literature.&#x201d; But the scene, as he found it, was dominated by &#x201c;talented fakes,&#x201d; so&#x2014;to use his words&#x2014;&#x201c;only a terrorist campaign would I suffice&#x201d; to effect radical change. This book offers the record of the first phase of that campaign, culminating with &#x201c;One Way Street,&#x201d; one of the most significant products of the German avant-garde of the Twenties. Against conformism, homogeneity, and gentrification of all life into a new world order, Benjamin made the word his sword. Volume I of the <i>Selected Writings</i> brings together essays long and short, academic treatises, reviews, fragments, and privately circulated pronouncements. Fully five-sixths of this material has never before been translated into English. The contents begin in 1913, when Benjamin, as an undergraduate in imperial Germany, was president of a radical youth group, and take us through 1926, when he had already begun, with his explorations of the world of mass culture, to emerge as a critical voice in Weimar Germany&#x2019;s most influential journals. The volume includes a number of his most important works, including &#x201c;Two Poems by Friedrich H�lderlin,&#x201d; &#x201c;Goethe&#x2019;s Elective Affinities,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Concept of Criticism in German Romanticism,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Task of the Translator,&#x201d; and &#x201c;One Way Street.&#x201d; He is as compelling and insightful when musing on riddles or children&#x2019;s books as he is when dealing with weightier issues such as the philosophy of language, symbolic logic, or epistemology. We meet Benjamin the youthful idealist, the sober moralist, the political theorist, the experimentalist, the translator, and, above all, the virtual king of criticism, with his magisterial exposition of the basic problems of aesthetics. Benjamin&#x2019;s sentences provoke us to return to them again and again, luring us as though with the promise of some final revelation that is always being postponed. He is by turns fierce and tender, melancholy and ebullient; he is at once classically rooted, even archaic, in his explorations of the human psyche and the world of things, and strikingly progressive in his attitude toward society and what he likes to call the organs of the collective (its architectures, fashions, signboards). Throughout, he displays a far-sighted urgency, judging the present on the basis of possible futures. And he is gifted with a keen sense of humor. Mysterious though he may sometimes be (his Latvian love, Asia Lacis, once described him as a visitor from another planet), Benjamin remains perhaps the most consistently surprising and challenging of critical writers.</p><p>A leading German critic of his day and a member of the generation scarred by the First World War, Walter Benjamin&#39;s writing career was marked by deep philosophical insights and tumultuous emotional crises. His work has mostly been unavailable in English translations, but this collection marks the first of three proposed volumes of his essays. In his early work, we encounter Benjamin as an idealistic university student and come to see him commenting on the aesthetics of such subjects as morality in children&#39;s books, the uses of force and violence, and writers such as Goethe and Dostoyevsky.Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) was the author of many works of literary and cultural analysis.</p><h2>Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984-1988</h2><p>This is a fascinating, if somewhat opinionated, look at the last of four years of the Reagan presidency.

The book begins with a rapid course on manifolds and differential forms, emphasizing how these provide a proper language for formulating Maxwell&#39;s equations on arbitrary spacetimes. The authors then introduce vector bundles, connections and curvature in order to generalize Maxwell theory to the Yang-Mills equations. The relation of gauge theory to the newly discovered knot invariants such as the Jones polynomial is sketched. Riemannian geometry is then introduced in order to describe Einstein&#39;s equations of general relativity and show how an attempt to quantize gravity leads to interesting applications of knot theory.</p><p>&#34;This book is a great introduction to many of the modern ideas of mathematical physics including differential geometry, group theory, knot theory and topology. It uses as &#39;physical excuses&#39; to introduce these topics Maxwell theory, Yang-Mills theories and general relativity (including its Ashtekar reformulation). The level of the book is gauged to advanced physics/math undergraduates and graduate students. The style of the book is quite lively and explanations are very clear. The treatment is mathematically and physically self-contained ... I would strongly recommend this nicely written book for anyone interested in teaching the contemporary ideas of mathematical physics to an audience of physicists (especially if that audience is interested in particle physics/gravity). It offers an excellent way of treating the subject with mathematical rigor while keeping the physical motivation and usefulness of these mathematical concepts close at hand. For the individual reader, it is a great way to be lured into the study of the mathematics that underlies contemporary theoretical physics.&#34;&#34;The book is clearly written and should be accessible to readers who have a good undergraduate preparation in mathematics or physics. Each part of the book ends with a list of references that will enable the reader to pursue the material presented in greater detail.&#34;</p><h2>Maigret in Vichy (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b>When his relaxing vacation is interrupted by a small-town murder, Inspector Maigret can't resist lending his investigative powers to the case</b><br><br>Inspector Maigret and his wife take a much needed holiday to Vichy, where they quickly become used to the slower pace of life.

Acclaimed historian G. J. Meyer reveals the flesh-and-bone reality in all its wild excess.<br><br>In 1485, young Henry Tudor, whose claim to the throne was so weak as to be almost laughable, crossed the English Channel from France at the head of a ragtag little army and took the crown from the family that had ruled England for almost four hundred years. Half a century later his son, Henry VIII, desperate to rid himself of his first wife in order to marry a second, launched a reign of terror aimed at taking powers no previous monarch had even dreamed of possessing. In the process he plunged his kingdom into generations of division and disorder, creating a legacy of blood and betrayal that would blight the lives of his children and the destiny of his country.<br><br>The boy king Edward VI, a fervent believer in reforming the English church, died before bringing to fruition his dream of a second English Reformation. Mary I, the disgraced daughter of Catherine of Aragon, tried and failed to reestablish the Catholic Church and produce an heir. And finally came Elizabeth I, who devoted her life to creating an image of herself as Gloriana the Virgin Queen but, behind that mask, sacrificed all chance of personal happiness in order to survive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Tudors</b> weaves together all the sinners and saints, the tragedies and triumphs, the high dreams and dark crimes, that reveal the Tudor era to be, in its enthralling, notorious truth, as momentous and as fascinating as the fictions audiences have come to love.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: G.J. Meyer on <em>The Tudors</em></strong> <br> <p> </p><p><i>Why?</i></p> <p>That question is likely to be--and probably should be--sparked by the appearance of almost any new book about the Tudors. Does the world really need more words about the dynasty that produced King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I? Those two are already the most written-about monarchs in English history, after all. They&#x2019;re the subjects of so many movies, novels and TV dramas that sometimes they seem to be not figures out of the past but living showbiz celebrities. Why should anyone want to read about them yet again?</p> <p>I offer two answers.</p> <p>First, though the number of books about the most famous Tudors is practically infinite, single volumes dealing with the entire dynasty and aimed at a general readership have always been rare. This is unfortunate, because it deprives a great story of its proper context. The legendary career of Henry VIII would have been impossible if not for the exploits--in some ways far more astonishing--of his father Henry VII, a penniless fugitive who came almost out of nowhere to seize the crown. And Elizabeth was only the third of Henry VIII&#x2019;s children to inherit his throne and struggle to deal with his blood-soaked legacy. She had a brother and sister, both of whom ruled before her and tried without success (in radically different ways) to undo what Henry had done. Her story comes fully to life only when illuminated by theirs. The Tudors ruled England for three generations--118 years in all--and not nearly enough has been done to deal with their five reigns as a continuum, a chain of causes and effects that cumulatively changed the course of English, European, and even world history, often in tragic ways. </p> <p>Second, more than four centuries after the death of the last Tudor, there continues to be an immense gap between who the various members of the family actually were and what most people--including most people with some knowledge of English history--think they know about them. The real Henry VIII was both a greater and lesser man than the lusty Bluff King Hal of legend, the man who famously had six wives. Elizabeth was vastly more complicated, more pathetic and less noble than the glorious fa�ade behind which she concealed herself. The now-obscure Henry VII, Edward VI, and Mary I were both more important as rulers and far more fascinating as human beings than is commonly understood.</p> <p>The true shape of the Tudor story has been long obscured, even for leading historians, by religious controversy and differences of political ideology. It is only in the past couple of generations, as ancient passions have cooled, that the story has come into clear focus, and too often it has done so only for the historians themselves. For the public at large, the truth has continued to be overwhelmed by old legends with too little basis in fact. My hope for <i>The Tudors</i>, as it goes to press, is that it will help to bring popular understanding of one of history&#x2019;s most deservedly famous dynasties into closer alignment with reality. <em>--G.J.

Tolstoy charts the course of the doomed love affair between Anna, a beautiful married woman, and Count Vronsky, a wealthy army officer who pursues Anna after becoming infatuated with her at a ball. Although she initially resists his charms Anna eventually succumbs, falling passionately in love and setting in motion a chain of events that lead to her downfall. In this extraordinary novel Tolstoy seamlessly weaves together the lives of dozens of characters, while evoking a love so strong that those who experience it are prepared to die for it.</p><p><b>Leo Tolstoy</b> (1828-1910) is best-known for his masterpieces <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>.<b> Louise Maude</b> and<b> Aylmer Maud</b>e were English translator of Tolstoy's work, of whom Tolstoy said "Better translators . . . could not be invented."Tolstoy&#39;s great novel portrays a tragic love affair against a backdrop of nineteenth-century Russian high society and country life. Kate Lock&#39;s treatment shows impressive range and facility, at times achieving remarkable power and poignancy. She skillfully provides a wide variety of voices--often indicating men just by changing intonation and pitch--and manages to convey Anna&#39;s loveliness by voice alone, giving her a kind of bell-like throatiness. Unfortunately, some of her male voices--indicated by roughening or straining her voice--are unconvincing. But any flaws are swallowed up by the magnitude of the work--Tolstoy&#39;s and hers--and by her predominant talent and deft touch.

It's even more of that "Ah ha, so that' s how they do it," straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff people can really use today, and that made volume 1 the world's best-selling book on digital photography.<br> <br>This book truly has a brilliant premise, and here's how Scott describes it: "If you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, 'Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?' I wouldn't give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, I'd just turn to you and say, 'Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.'

It provides numerous cases that illustrate both successes and failures in engineering design; qualitative presentation of engineering practices are easily understood by readers with little technical knowledge, and analytical techniques are given that allow the development and evaluation of proposed engineering solutions. <b> </b> Coverage includes: an overview of engineering design, needs assessment, structuring the search for the problem, structuring the search for a solution (design goals and specifications), acquiring and applying technical knowledge, abstraction and modeling, synthesis, ethics and product liability issues, and hazards analysis and failure analysis. <b> </b> An excellent handbook for design engineers. </p></p><p>Gerard Voland has taught design for 20 years and pioneered an innovative, nationally recognized freshman design course at Northeastern University. In 1994 he was named the George A. Snell Professor of Engineering in appreciation for his work with this freshman design course and with engineering curriculum reform at Northeastern. He is also the author of textbooks on engineering graphics and control systems modeling. He lives in in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, with his wife, Margaret Voland, a mathematician who researched and developed the case problems in this book.<p><b>Rationale for the Text</b></p> <p> <i>Engineering by Design</i> is intended to serve a multiplicity of functions while conveying the excitement and sheer fun of solving technical problems in creative yet practical ways. It provides an introduction to the engineering profession through numerous case histories that illustrate various aspects of the design process. This is important because students can come to appreciate the interdisciplinary aspects of engineering problem solving as they work with case problems or review case histories in design which demonstrate (sometimes in a very startling but effective manner) valuable lessons in engineering practice. </p> <p> Many engineering colleges are continuing to revise their curricula in response to the ABET 2000 accreditation requirements. Various design and manufacturing topics are being integrated more into undergraduate engineering programs, and new mechanisms for delivering this course material are being developed with a general focus upon experiential learning by undergraduates. <i>Engineering by Design</i> has been developed as an aid for these important efforts. It is written in a way that I hope will be both engaging and accessible to students while maintaining the accuracy and rigor that one would expect of an engineering textbook. </p> <p> Freshmen and sophomores often have little substantive knowledge of professional engineering practice; indeed, these students may have many misconceptions about the actual work that engineers perform and the types of problems with which they wrestle. The initial chapters and case histories of this book will give students a limited but informed understanding of the engineering profession. Later material (including case problems through which students can apply their newly acquired knowledge of design) then broadens and deepens this understanding, and this material can be used in a wide variety of courses including senior capstone project classes. A list of appropriate courses is given later in this preface. </p> <p> Through this approach, students discover the need to </p> <ul> <li>formulate problems correctly</li> <li>work successfully in interdisciplinary teams</li> <li>develop their creativity, imagination, and analytical skills</li> <li>make informed ethical decisions</li> <li>hone their written and oral communication skills</li> </ul> <p> Most important, they learn that engineering is a service profession, dedicated to satisfying humanity's needs through responsible, methodical, and creative problem solving. </p> <p> This second edition of <i>Engineering by Design</i> includes expanded coverage of several important topics, including teamwork skills and tools, Gantt charts, problem formulation strategies, engineering graphics and sketching, and creativity stimulation techniques. Moreover, numerous additional case histories have been incorporated into the text. </p> <p><b>Structure</b></p> <p><b>Case Histories</b></p> <p> <i>Engineering By Design</i> introduces students to such critical design topics as needs assessment, problem formulation, modeling, patents, abstraction and synthesis, economic analysis, product liability, ergonomics, engineering ethics, hazards analysis, design for X, materials selection, and manufacturing processes. The engineering design process provides the skeletal structure for the text, around which are wrapped numerous case histories that illustrate both successes and failures in engineering design. </p> <p> According to Larry Richards, Director of the Center for Computer Aided Engineering at the University of Virginia, engineering cases generally fall into one of three categories. They are case studies, case histories, and case problems. A <i>case study</i> presents an ideal or benchmark solution that may serve as a model for future work. In contrast, a <i>case history</i> describes how a problem was solved, and points out the consequences of the decisions that were made. This text contains numerous case histories; the more extensive ones have been collected at the end of each chapter so that they will not interrupt the flow of material in the chapters. Each case history has been selected to illustrate a particular principle, procedure, or lesson in the text. Students and faculty can use these case histories as important resources for study, reflection, and discussion. </p> <p><b>Design Project Assignment Template</b></p> <p> The text ends with a unique <i>Design Project Assignment Template</i> (immediately following Chapter 11) that the instructor can use to select and assign tasks to students who are working on a design project. With this template, instructors can directly correlate their students' efforts on a project with appropriate material from each chapter of this text. Of course, not all assignments need to be performed; the template provides a "menu" from which instructors can select tasks and topics that they wish to emphasize. </p> <p> This template also provides an abbreviated summary of the text with key concepts highlighted in <b>bold</b> type. Students can use this template to review and correlate the critical elements of the design process as they develop an overall perspective of the material presented throughout the text. If a term or concept in the template is not understood completely, the student should recognize that lack of understanding or comfort with the concept as a warning flag. The student should then return to the (referenced) section in the text in which the concept is discussed and study further. Through such efforts, the template can serve as an important learning aid. A sample section of the design template is shown in Figure P.1 </p> <p><b>Case Problems</b></p> <p> Finally, a <i>case problem</i> sets forth an open-ended (perhaps unsolved) situation that leaves the solution up to the reader. It can be a learning module designed to put students to work in teams to define the problem and solve it through research, discussion, and/or lab work. Four extended case problems have been prepared for use as active learning modules; they follow the Design Project Assignment Template. Each of these case problems contains a substantial amount of background information, as well as proposed or existing solutions, so that students will be able to "hit the ground running" if any of these problems is chosen for a design project. </p> <p> Moreover, these case problem modules serve as examples of the depth, breadth, and type of information that one should acquire about a technical problem before embarking upon the development of a design solution. The background material in each problem provides sufficient information to understand the general parameters and factors that must be considered during a design effort; however, students should seek additional information beyond that contained in the case problems. </p> <p> Immediately following the four case problems is a list of <i>50 case problem topics,</i> which describe situations that call for engineering design solutions. Since these descriptions are very brief, students will need to research the background and current status of each situation. Again, the four extended case problem modules described above can serve as examples of the type of background data that should be collected via such research. </p></p><h2>Smash!: Wile E.

With truth and insight, these personal, prophetic works speak to the heart of the experience of race and identity in the United States. Here are the full texts of <i>Notes of a Native Son, Nobody Knows My Name, The Fire Next Time, No Name in the Street, </i>and <i>The Devil Finds Work, </i>along with dozens of other pieces, ranging from a 1948 review of <i>Raintree Country </i>to a magnificent introduction to this book that, as so many of Mr. Baldwin's works do, combines his intensely private experience with the deepest examination of social interaction between the races. In a way, <i>The Price of the Ticket </i>is an intellectual history of the twentieth-century American experience; in another, it is autobiography of the highest order.<br></p><p><b>James Baldwin</b>'s celebrated works of fiction include <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, <i>Giovanni's Room</i>,<i> Another Century</i>, <i>Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone</i>, <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>, <i>Just Above My Head,</i> and the short story collection <i>Going to Meet the Man</i>. He was also the author of a book of poetry, <i>Jimmy's Blues</i>, two dramatic works, <i>Blues for Mister Charlie</i> and <i>The Amen Corner</i>, and many works of nonfiction, including <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i>, <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, and <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>. Born in Harlem in 1924, he lived for many years in France, where he died in 1987.<br>"Together, these essays document the changes and development of intellectual styles and values between the period when they were written for such magazines as <i>New Leader </i>and <i>Partisan Review </i>and the present . . . <i>The Price of the Ticket </i>collects much of the best work of one of our finest living writers."&#x2014;Sam Cornish,<i> The Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"James Baldwin's essays on race in America are enlightening, entertaining and, because of his remarkable prescience, a bit eerie . . . In these 51 pieces all of which appeared in magazines or previous collections, Mr. Baldwin covers a diverse range of subjects. But a theme runs through them all&#x2014;many of our national ills stem from a retreat from self-knowledge. This country's mistreatment of blacks is the best symbol of the discordance between the American myth and reality, Mr. Baldwin contends."&#x2014;Salim Muwakkil, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br>"James Baldwin became a national figure and remained one until his death, two years before which his collected nonfiction, <i>The Price of the Ticket</i>, came out. Anyone wishing to take Baldwin's measure as a man and writer while, incidentally, getting a vivid picture of Harlem during World War II, must begin with this book."&#x2014;William Corbett, author of <i>New York Literary Lights</i><br></p><h2>Machik&#39;s Complete Explanation: Clarifying the Meaning of Chod</h2><p>This book is the most famous book of teachings of Machik Labdron, the great female saint and yogini of 11 and 12th century Tibet, now finally translated in its entirely into English.</p><p>Fear, anger, and negativity are states that eqch of us have to contend with. Machik&#39;s Complete Explanation, the most famous book of the teachings of Machik Labdron, the great female sain and yogini of the 11th-12th century Tibet, addresses these issues in a practical, direct way. This valuable text is now finally translated in its entirety into English. Machik developed a system, the Mahamudra Chod, that takes the Buddha&#39;s teachings as a basis and applies them to the immediate experimences of negative mind states and malignant forces. Her unique feminine approach is to invoke and nurture the very &#34;demons&#34; that we fear and hate, transforming those reactive emotions into love. It is the tantric version of developing compassion and fearlessness, a radical method of cutting through ego-fixation.Sarah Harding is a lama in the Shangpa Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism.

Scott Fitzgerald, W. E. B. DuBois, James Baldwin, Eudora Welty, Stephen Jay Gould, John Updike, Saul Bellow, Joan Didion, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou, John McPhee, Rachel Carson, and other notable twentieth-century literary masters.</p><p>The title <i>The Best American Essays of the Century</i> seems transparent enough, but don't be deceived. What Joyce Carol Oates has assembled is not so much a diverse collection as a sonorous march through what keeps getting called the American century. Read this not as a collection to dip into but as a history--a history of race in America. Oates says it best herself in her introduction: "It can't be an accident that essays in this volume by men and women of ethnic minority backgrounds are outstanding; to paraphrase Melville, to write a 'mighty' work of prose you must have a 'mighty' theme." The mighty pens at work here belong to, among others, Zora Neale Hurston ("How It Feels to Be Colored Me"), Langston Hughes ("Bop"), and James Baldwin ("Notes of a Native Son"). Oates has opted not for the most unexpected but for the most important and stirring essays of our time.<p> Other chords sound repeatedly as well: the problem of our relationship with nature (Annie Dillard, John Muir, and Gretel Ehrlich); the difficulty of identity in disrupted times (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joan Didion, and Michael Herr). In her essay "The White Album," Didion famously declares: "We tell ourselves stories in order to live." The stories Oates has collected are not easy. Here is the hard-won truth, from writers unwilling to forgive even themselves. Even Martin Luther King Jr. doesn't let himself off the hook, as he writes in his "Letter from Birmingham Jail": "If I have said anything in this letter that is an overstatement of the truth and is indicative of an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything in this letter that is an understatement of the truth and is indicative of my having a patience that makes me patient with anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me." <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>JOYCE CAROL OATES -- novelist, essayist, critic, poet, playwright, teacher, and short story writer -- is one of the preeminent literary figures and social critics of the twentieth century.

The Apostles&#x2019; Creed was born from the apostles&#x2019; teachings. It contains essential doctrines and beliefs that summarize the gospel and the foundation of our faith. The scriptural truths contained in the creed enable us to build our Christian lives on good theology, with the knowledge that our faith is rooted in truth and a rich history.<br><br> The lines of the creed aren&#x2019;t mere words. They are the essence of what we confess and believe. Repeating the creed doesn&#x2019;t make disciples. Incantations don&#x2019;t transform us into better, more effective Christians. Creeds don&#x2019;t hold any authority apart from Scripture, but they do point outside themselves to the authoritative Word of God.<br><br> The Apostles&#x2019; Creed was traditionally used as a public confession before baptism. This confession of faith, given as a recitation of the creed, was understood as an act of turning away from previous pagan beliefs and fully accepting apostolic teaching.

Although Frank Lloyd Wright designed more than 1,000 projects during his long and prolific career, Auldbrass Plantation, in Yemassee, South Carolina, is the only plantation he ever designed. It is also one of the largest and most complex projects he ever undertook. Wright had an unusually intense commitment to Auldbrass, and worked on it, off and on, for more than twenty years, from 1938 until his death in 1959. Because Auldbrass was private and because it fell into disrepair in the 1960s after the owners' death, it was rarely photographed or studied, and as a consequence little has been known about this major work. With a recently completed restoration and new photography, this book affords a rare opportunity to see one of Wright's greatest works, as the master himself originally envisioned it. Through photos, plans, and drawings, we see what Wright planned, and how it has finally all been either restored or realized for the first time. In 1986, film producer Joel Silver (<i>Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, 48 Hours, Predator, Romeo Must Die, The Matrix,</i> and over forty other films) bought Auldbrass. He had earlier bought and meticulously restored Wright's famous 1923 Storer House in Hollywood. Now he has again collaborated with Wright's grandson, architect Eric Lloyd Wright, who restored the Storer House, to restore the Auldbrass Plantation.</p><p><b>David G.

This is the story of Azar Nafisi&#x2019;s dream and of the nightmare that made it come true.<br><br>For two years before she left Iran in 1997, Nafisi gathered seven young women at her house every Thursday morning to read and discuss forbidden works of Western literature. They were all former students whom she had taught at university. Some came from conservative and religious families, others were progressive and secular; several had spent time in jail. They were shy and uncomfortable at first, unaccustomed to being asked to speak their minds, but soon they began to open up and to speak more freely, not only about the novels they were reading but also about themselves, their dreams and disappointments. Their stories intertwined with those they were reading&#x2014;Pride and Prejudice, Washington Square, Daisy Miller and Lolita&#x2014;their Lolita, as they imagined her in Tehran.<br><br>Nafisi&#x2019;s account flashes back to the early days of the revolution, when she first started teaching at the University of Tehran amid the swirl of protests and demonstrations. In those frenetic days, the students took control of the university, expelled faculty members and purged the curriculum. When a radical Islamist in Nafisi&#x2019;s class questioned her decision to teach The Great Gatsby, which he saw as an immoral work that preached falsehoods of &#x201c;the Great Satan,&#x201d; she decided to let him put Gatsby on trial and stood as the sole witness for the defense.<br><br>Azar Nafisi&#x2019;s luminous tale offers a fascinating portrait of the Iran-Iraq war viewed from Tehran and gives us a rare glimpse, from the inside, of women&#x2019;s lives in revolutionary Iran. It is a work of great passion and poetic beauty, written with a startlingly original voice.</p><p>An inspired blend of memoir and literary criticism, <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i> is a moving testament to the power of art and its ability to change and improve people's lives. In 1995, after resigning from her job as a professor at a university in Tehran due to repressive policies, Azar Nafisi invited seven of her best female students to attend a weekly study of great Western literature in her home. Since the books they read were officially banned by the government, the women were forced to meet in secret, often sharing photocopied pages of the illegal novels. For two years they met to talk, share, and "shed their mandatory veils and robes and burst into color." Though most of the women were shy and intimidated at first, they soon became emboldened by the forum and used the meetings as a springboard for debating the social, cultural, and political realities of living under strict Islamic rule. They discussed their harassment at the hands of "morality guards," the daily indignities of living under the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime, the effects of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, love, marriage, and life in general, giving readers a rare inside look at revolutionary Iran. The books were always the primary focus, however, and they became "essential to our lives: they were not a luxury but a necessity," she writes. <p></p><p> Threaded into the memoir are trenchant discussions of the work of Vladimir Nabokov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen, and other authors who provided the women with examples of those who successfully asserted their autonomy despite great odds. The great works encouraged them to strike out against authoritarianism and repression in their own ways, both large and small: "There, in that living room, we rediscovered that we were also living, breathing human beings; and no matter how repressive the state became, no matter how intimidated and frightened we were, like Lolita we tried to escape and to create our own little pockets of freedom," she writes. In short, the art helped them to survive. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>&#x201c;Anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book. Azar Nafisi takes us into the vivid lives of eight women who must meet in secret to explore the forbidden fiction of the West. It is at once a celebration of the power of the novel and a cry of outrage at the reality in which these women are trapped. The ayatollahs don&#x2019;t know it, but Nafisi is one of the heroes of the Islamic Republic.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Geraldine Brooks, author of <i>Nine Parts of Desire</i><br><br> &#x201c;I was enthralled and moved by Azar Nafisi&#x2019;s account of how she defied, and helped others to defy, radical Islam&#x2019;s war against women. Her memoir contains important and properly complex reflections about the ravages of theocracy, about thoughtfulness, and about the ordeals of freedom&#x2014;as well as a stirring account of the pleasures and deepening of consciousness that result from an encounter with great literature and with an inspired teacher.&#x201d;&#x2014;Susan Sontag<br><br>&#x201c;When I first saw Azar Nafisi teach, she was standing in a university classroom in Tehran, holding a bunch of red fake poppies in one hand and a bouquet of daffodils in the other, and asking, What is kitsch? Now, mesmerizingly, she reveals the shimmering worlds she created in those classrooms, inside a revolution that was an apogee of kitsch and cruelty. Here, people think for themselves because James and Fitzgerald and Nabokov sing out against authoritarianism and repression.

Written in 1851 as a money-maker for the struggling Hawthorne, <em>A Wonder Book</em> has become a favorite for generations of children everywhere. Hawthorne's mastery of adventure and his command of narrative and character open a child's mind to the wondrous landscapes of ancient mythology in stories such as "The Gorgon's Head" and "The Three Golden Apples." Oxford has created a beautiful and memorable edition of this classic children's text with illustrations by famed book artist Walter Crane, whose full-color plates and decorative art originally accompanied the text in the late 1800s. An introduction by Ola d'Aulaire, son of the creators of <em>D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths</em>, sets the stage for the young reader, and an afterword for adults by Hawthorne scholar Joel Pfister places <em>A Wonder Book</em> in Hawthorne's body of work and in historical context, conveying the strength of its romantic imagination in the face of the encroaching Industrial Revolution. Adults and collectors will find this major new edition a treasure and their children will happily enter a world of magic and imagination, led by one of the greatest American storytellers.</p><p><br><strong>Nathaniel Hawthorne</strong> (1804-1864), though best known for his novels and short stories for adults, also produced several works for children, including a companion volume to <em>A Wonder Book</em> called <em>Tanglewood Tales</em> (1853).<br> <em>About the Illustrator:</em><br> <strong>Walter Crane</strong> (1845-1915) was one of the most popular English illustrators of children's books in the late nineteenth century. He was one of the first book artists to experiment with color in picture books.<br>From Seven Gables to Six Myths<br>"A handsome replica of the original 1893 edition, A Wonder Book for Girls and Boys by Nathaniel Hawthorne features Medusa, Hercules, Pandora, Midas et al--and the art of the illustrious Walter Crane.... Crane's color plates are lushly romantic in style; the plainer printed story titles and<br>illuminated letters are just as beautiful."--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Hawthorne's delightful retelling of Greek myths displays his command of narrative and character as well as his sense of adventure. The stories of Midas, Medusa, Hercules, and others will delight both children and adult readers."--The Tampa Tribune Times<br><br>"A marvelous recreation of mythological tales in text and drawing. A delight for all ages."--King Features Syndicate<br><br>"An exceptionally fine series of Hawthorne retellings of Greek classics.... An excellent keepsake edition."--The Children's Bookwatch<br><br>"These stories have seldom been better dressed."--Book Reviews on the Internet</p><h2>Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion</h2><p>Finally, social scientists have begun to attempt to understand religious behavior rather than to discredit it as irrational, ignorant, or foolish&#x2015;and Rodney Stark and Roger Finke have played a major role in this new approach. Acknowledging that science cannot assess the supernatural side of religion (and therefore should not claim to do so), Stark and Finke analyze the observable, human side of faith. In clear and engaging prose, the authors combine explicit theorizing with animated discussions as they move from considering the religiousness of individuals to the dynamics of religious groups and then to the religious workings of entire societies as religious groups contend for support. The result is a comprehensive new paradigm for the social-scientific study of religion.</p><p>"<i>Acts of Faith</i> is the single 'big book' in the sociology of religion in the past decade, a monumental effort that both demolishes old theories and creates brilliant new ones. Stark and Finke have mastered the literature in the field, gathered ingenious data analysis to sustain their positions, and presented their work with flair, imagination, and brilliance. Though it is quite impossible to turn around the social science profession completely with a single book, or indeed within a single decade, these two authors have achieved a powerful beginning in this task. This landmark publication marks a turning point."&#x2015;Andrew M. Greeley, University of Chicago<br><br>"This book is a major next step in developing the sociology of religion's 'new paradigm'--an important summary of the evolving 'religious economies' theory. Stark and Finke's spirited deconstruction of antireligious secularization theories and other theories of 'irrational' religion is simply delightful. And its own constructive theory offers a valuable resource for those friendly to the rational choice approach to religion, as well as a continuing challenge to its critics."&#x2015;Christian Smith, University of North Carolina<b>Rodney Stark</b> is Professor of Sociology and Comparative Religion at the University of Washington.

She argues that Nietzsche, Heidegger, Gadamer, Strauss, and Derrida, convinced that modern rationalism had exhausted its possibilities, all turned to Plato in order to rediscover the original character of philosophy and to reconceive the Western tradition as a whole. Zuckert's artful juxtaposition of these seemingly disparate bodies of thought furnishes a synoptic view, not merely of these individual thinkers, but of the broad postmodern landscape as well. The result is a brilliantly conceived work that offers an innovative perspective on the relation between the Western philosophical tradition and the evolving postmodern enterprise.<br></p><p>Catherine Zuckert examines the work of five key philosophical figures from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and through the lens of their own distinctive and decidedly postmodern readings of Plato.

This book can be used as a brief introduction to design of experiments. This successful, calculus-based book of probability and statistics, was one of the first to make real-world applications an integral part of motivating discussion. The number of problem sets has increased in all sections. Some sections include almost 50% new problems, while the most popular case studies remain. <b></b> For anyone needing to develop proficiency with Mathematical Statistics. </p></p><p>Highly structured, this volume allows those with an established mathematics background to pursue a more rigorous, advanced treatment of probability and statistics.Preface <p> Changes in this third edition have been primarily motivated by our own teaching experiences as well as by the comments of others who use the text. Technology, though, has also dictated certain revisions. The widespread use of statistical software packages has brought certain topics and concepts to the fore, while diminishing the relevance of others. All in all, we feel that this new edition has a sharper focus and that students will find it more accessible and easier to use. </p><p> Many of the major changes come in the middle third of the book, much of which has been rewritten. These are the chapters that make the critical transition from probability to statistics. We have taken a variety of steps to make that material come more alive, ranging from the addition of more helpful examples to the frequent use of computer simulations. </p><p> Chapter 4, for example, now addresses more fully the important question of why certain measurements are modeled by particular probability functions. Relationships that exist between pdfs are given more attention, and the connection between theoretical models and sample data is explored in greater depth. Chapter 5 has been restructured. In the new edition, methods of estimation come first and the underlying theory is taken up last. That arrangement makes it easier for instructors to adjust the amount of time spent on estimation to whatever suits their individual needs. In Chapter 6, the principles of decision-making are now introduced in the context of testing Ho: � = �o rather than Ho: p = po. The result is a more streamlined presentation that avoids the complications inherent in a test statistic whose pdf is discrete. </p><p> Positioned between Chapter 7, which deals with the normal distribution, and Chapters 9 through 14, where the various techniques for analyzing data are introduced, is a new chapter on experimental design. Chapter 8 profiles seven of the most frequently encountered "data models." The basic characteristics of each design are discussed as well as the types of questions each seeks to answer. By providing a framework and a theme, Chapter 8 brings cohesion and a sense of order to the chapters that follow. </p><p> Chapter 11 (Regression) has also been changed substantially. It now begins with curve-fitting, then introduces the linear model, and eventually concludes with the bivariate normal. Regression "diagnostics" have been added to the new edition, and the various inference procedures associated with the linear model have been explained and delineated more carefully. </p><p> Our overriding motivation in deciding which topics to present &#x2013; and in what order &#x2013; stem from our objective to write a book that emphasizes the interrelation between probability theory, mathematical statistics, and data analysis. We believe that integrating all three is vitally important, particularly for those students who take only one statistics course during their college careers. Our experience in the classroom has certainly strengthened our faith in this approach: Students can more clearly see the importance of each of the three when viewed in the context of the other two.</p></p><h2>5 Voices: How to Communicate Effectively with Everyone You Lead</h2><p><b>Discover your leadership voice and unlock your potential to influence others</b> <p><i>5 Voices</i> is the code for unlocking your capacity to have honest conversations and build deeper, more authentic relationships with your teams, your families and your friends.

By exploring the myriad constructions of female identity and the body in our culture, Sherman imitates and confronts assorted representational stereotypes, becoming for many an icon of the contemporary concerns of feminism and postmodernism.<br>Essayists Amada Cruz, Elizabeth A. T. Smith, and Amelia Jones offer keen insight and observations from several distinct vantage points, demonstrating that Sherman's work is a lens through which to view contemporary art and its ongoing concern with the profound issues of the structures of the self. More than 200 images show the breadth of Sherman's body of work, from the Untitled Film Stills of the 1970s to series such as Centerfolds, Fashion, Disasters, Fairy Tales, and History Portraits, as well as photographs influenced by surrealist artists. Also included are intriguing excerpts from Sherman's notebooks, selections from her contact sheets, and numerous Polaroid studies, all of which shed light on the artist's process.</p><p><b>Amanda Cruz</b> is the Manilow Curator of Exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. <b>Elizabeth A. T. Smith</b> is Curator at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. <b>Amelia Jones</b> is an associate professor of contemporary art and theory and the history of photography at the University of California, Riverside.Cindy Sherman has taken self-portraiture and masquerade to the highest heights and the campiest lows, bringing the shady ambience of B-movies to art photography while exploring the plexus of narcissism, from its silliest manifestations to its most provocative expressions. Sherman explores the implications of role-playing and fantasy, seeing and being seen, and society's perceptions of women, eroticism, and consumerism in her photographs, creating resonant images and supplying art critics with much grist for their mills. In her contribution to this retrospective volume, Amelia Jones begins with the remark that "much ink has been spilled over Cindy Sherman," and, obviously, the flow continues, but Jones, Cruz, and their colleagues provide just the sort of commentary Sherman's work demands, and the photographs themselves are engaging, both viscerally and intellectually. Sherman has been in costume before her own camera for more than 20 years, earning the right to a major traveling exhibition and speculation as to what she'll come up with next.

Walker Percy, the highly regarded author of The Moviegoer, wrote six novels, two volumes of philosophical writings, and numerous essays. Shelby Foote met with early success as a novelist, but his reputation today rests more upon his massive three-volume narrative history of the Civil War, and his role as commentator in Ken Burns's documentary The Civil War. The correspondence between Percy and Foote traces their lives from the beginning of their respective careers, when they were grappling fiercely and openly with their ambitions, artistic doubts, and personal problems. Although they discuss such serious matters as the death of Foote's mother and Percy's battle with cancer, their letters are full of sly humor and good-natured ribbing. Jay Tolson has selected, edited, and annotated the letters of these two remarkable writers to shed light on their relationship and their literary careers. Includes an eight-page insert with photographs of the writers chronicling their friendship.</p><p>Mississippi has produced some of the nation's finest literary voices, includingShelby Foote and Walker Percy. Foote spent much of his career reconstructing the Civil War in a 1.6 million-word trilogy (he was the smooth-drawling storyteller in Kenneth Burns's television series on the conflict). Percy was a philosophical novelist whose work includes <i>The Moviegoer</i> and <i>The Thanatos Syndrome</i>. Not only were the two friends, but they corresponded for years, leaving behind a series of letters unearthed by biographer Jay Tolson. Tolson, the author of an exhaustive book on Percy, <i>Pilgrim in the Ruins</i>, shows that, unlike other Southern writers such as William Faulkner, Foote and Percy always acted as quite decent fellows, Southerners with manners and brains.Jay Tolson is the author of the biography Pilgrim in the Ruins: A Life of Walker Percy and is the editor of the Wilson Quarterly. He lives in Arlington, Virginia.</p><h2>Judges</h2><p>Judges records the birth pangs of the Israelite nation. From the Conquest to the Settlement, the conflicts in this book (military, political, and religious) reveal a nascent Israel, struggling to define itself as a people.<br><br>The period of the Judges, c. 1200-1100 B.C.E., was fraught with intertribal struggles, skirmishes and pitched battles with neighboring peoples, and the constant threat of assimilation. The Israelites repeatedly turned away from their God: ignored his commandments, worshipped other gods, and continually sinned. Yahweh raised up judges to lead the people back to covenant faithfulness. In their several roles as priest, prophet, and military chief of staff, these judges heeded God's call and led the people. In the Book of Judges, we get rare glimpses into the exceptional qualities and human frailties of these leaders. The approachable stories, the humor, and even the criticism of the children of Israel and the judges surprisingly illuminate a people in transition.<br><br>Boling's in-depth introduction and commentary explain the historical background, the sociocultural and religious milieu, and the literary complexities of the book. His fresh translation draws the modern reader into the dynamic stories while conveying the nuance of the Hebrew text.<br><br>Robert G.

She is the author of several published articles, and specializes in the research of understanding of how breastfeeding and lactation influence both maternal and child health and well-being. Recent research has focused on investigating how maternal diet influences milk fat content and, thus, energy intake and fatty acid consumption of the breastfeeding child. Dr. McGuire has been teaching the basic nutrition course for several years and has a strong appreciation of the course, its goals and objectives, and the variety of student needs. This experience coupled with her strong writing and research background has helped her create an exciting and refreshing text for the introductory nutrition course.<br><br>Dr. Beerman teaches in the School of Biological Sciences at Washington State University.

In museums, galleries, and the art market, previously overlooked female artists, past and present, are now gaining recognition and value. Featuring more than 400 artists from more than 50 countries and spanning 500 years of creativity, each artist is represented here by a key artwork and short text. This essential volume reveals a parallel yet equally engaging history of art for an age that champions a greater diversity of voices.</p> <p>"Real changes are upon us, and today one can reel off the names of a number of first-rate women artists.

Women artists put firmly on the map... Every now and then a book comes out that can change lives. If a survey like this had appeared when I was a student at the Slade, the struggle to make headway as a female artist would have seemed less daunting. We'd have had role models and names with which to counter the assertion that there had never been any significant women artists. And the recent explosion of female talent celebrated in this book might have happened a generation earlier. Phaidon's latest offering is a revelation... This impressive survey spans 500 years... It's incredibly hard to distill a life's work into a few hundred words, but these 23 writers do an excellent job of summarising the salient points... The burgeoning numbers of women now making and exhibiting work is reflected in this selection. Most impressive is the quality and diversity of work... This inspiring book is not just a celebration of women's creativity, it is symptomatic of a sea change... Things they are a-changing - at last.

Drawing on his expertise in economic history and the imperial histories of Britain and Europe, A. G. Hopkins takes readers from the colonial era to today to show how, far from diverging, the United States and Western Europe followed similar trajectories throughout this long period, and how America&#x2019;s dependency on Britain and Europe extended much later into the nineteenth century than previously understood.</p><p>In a sweeping narrative spanning three centuries, Hopkins describes how the revolt of the mainland colonies was the product of a crisis that afflicted the imperial states of Europe generally, and how the history of the American republic between 1783 and 1865 was a response not to the termination of British influence but to its continued expansion. He traces how the creation of a U.S. industrial nation-state after the Civil War paralleled developments in Western Europe, fostered similar destabilizing influences, and found an outlet in imperialism through the acquisition of an insular empire in the Caribbean and Pacific. The period of colonial rule that followed reflected the history of the European empires in its ideological justifications, economic relations, and administrative principles. After 1945, a profound shift in the character of globalization brought the age of the great territorial empires to an end.</p><p><i>American Empire</i> goes beyond the myth of American exceptionalism to place the United States within the wider context of the global historical forces that shaped the Western empires and the world.</p></p><p><p>"Compelling, provocative, and learned. This book is a stunning and sophisticated reevaluation of the American empire. Hopkins tells an old story in a truly new way--American history will never be the same again."<b>--Jeremi Suri, author of <i>The Impossible Presidency: The Rise and Fall of America's Highest Office</i></b></p><p>"One of the great British historians of our time reinterprets U.S. history from a truly global perspective, showing how the formation and international rise of the United States was entwined with processes of imperial expansion and global integration. This is a game-changing book that reveals as never before how the United States has fit into global patterns of historical change and development. <i>American Empire</i> is required reading for anyone interested in how we have arrived at our present state of international instability."<b>--Jay Sexton, author of <i>The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth-Century America</i></b></p><p>"With wit and enormous erudition, Hopkins offers us a new view on the phenomenon of the United States in global history, from its colonial origins to the Iraq War, with special attention to how it became itself a colonial power in the Caribbean and Pacific. The originality and power of <i>American Empire</i> begins in its demand that the United States was a postcolonial empire: it both resisted and imitated British and European power, even while it denied such influence and asserted its exceptionality. It is both a foundational work for a new American imperial history and a demonstration of how the problem of the United States can make us think in fresh ways about the broader history of empire and globalization."<b>--Richard Drayton, author of <i>Nature&#x2019;s Government: Science, Imperial Britain, and the "Improvement" of the World</i></b></p><p>"Hopkins has written a remarkable, learned work that makes its central point well and provides numerous leads for future scholarship. He argues that American empire can be understood only within the dynamics of globalization and worldwide imperial formation and contestation. <i>American Empire</i> is likely to become a standard book in U.S. and world history."<b>--Ian Tyrrell, author of <i>Crisis of the</i> <i>Wasteful Nation: Empire and Conservation in Theodore Roosevelt's America</i></b></p><p>"Hopkins situates the history of the United States within a broader global history, overcoming the confines of exceptionalist thought and connecting developments in American empire to a narrative that encompasses British and European imperialism as well. This is an ambitious work."<b>--Julian Go, author of <i>Patterns of Empire: The British and American Empires, 1688 to the Present</i></b></p><b>A. G. Hopkins</b> is Emeritus Smuts Professor of Commonwealth History at the University of Cambridge and former Walter Prescott Webb Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin.

He lives in Cambridge, England.</p><h2>Empires and Barbarians: The Fall of Rome and the Birth of Europe</h2><p><em>Empires and Barbarians</em> presents a fresh, provocative look at how a recognizable Europe came into being in the first millennium AD. With sharp analytic insight, Peter Heather explores the dynamics of migration and social and economic interaction that changed two vastly different worlds--the undeveloped barbarian world and the sophisticated Roman Empire--into remarkably similar societies and states. <br><br>The book's vivid narrative begins at the time of Christ, when the Mediterranean circle, newly united under the Romans, hosted a politically sophisticated, economically advanced, and culturally developed civilization--one with philosophy, banking, professional armies, literature, stunning architecture, even garbage collection. The rest of Europe, meanwhile, was home to subsistence farmers living in small groups, dominated largely by Germanic speakers. Although having some iron tools and weapons, these mostly illiterate peoples worked mainly in wood and never built in stone. The farther east one went, the simpler it became: fewer iron tools and ever less productive economies. And yet ten centuries later, from the Atlantic to the Urals, the European world had turned. Slavic speakers had largely superseded Germanic speakers in central and Eastern Europe, literacy was growing, Christianity had spread, and most fundamentally, Mediterranean supremacy was broken.<br><br>Bringing the whole of first millennium European history together, and challenging current arguments that migration played but a tiny role in this unfolding narrative, <em>Empires and Barbarians</em> views the destruction of the ancient world order in light of modern migration and globalization patterns.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Heather</strong> is Professor of Medieval History at King's College London.

"He has conferred more meaning on us than any other artist of the century. He is the founding master and tutelary spirit of democratic realism."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collection, selected by Shelby Foote, presents seventy of Chekhov's early short stories, written between 1883 and 1888, in celebrated translations by Constance Garnett. One of the most memorable is "The Death of a Government Clerk," a glorious parody in which a fawning official is undone by an ill-timed sneeze. "On the Road," the history of an educated man's search for convictions, is one of Chekhov's finest dramatic stories and the source of his first full-length play, Ivanov. And in "The Steppe," which marked a turning point in Chekhov's career, a boy's picaresque journey across the Russian heartland evokes the soul of Russia itself. Also included are "The Huntsman," "Anyuta," "Easter Eve," "Happiness," and "The Kiss."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chekhov is a superb anatomist of the human heart and an utter master of his literary means," said John Barth. "The details of scene and behavior, the emotions registered--seldom bravura, typically muted and complex, often as surprising to the characters themselves as to the reader, but always right--move, astonish, and delight us line after line, story after story." Eudora Welty agreed: "Chekhov, speaking simply and never otherwise than as an artist and a humane man, showed us in fullness and plenitude the mystery of our lives. . . . What truth [he] found through his stories is ours forever."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelby Foote has provided an Introduction for this edition.</p><p>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twentieth-century consciousness didn't begin on the stroke of midnight 1899, but in the minds of the outriders of human society--the artists--some time before. As early as 1886, when Chekhov wrote 'Anyuta' out of his daily experiences as a medical student, he showed that in the apparently inconsequential lie the enormities of human behavior; in ellipsis--if the writer is good enough to convey this--is what people feel and leave unsaid. . . . Those of us who write short stories--could we, if there had been no Chekhov?

The activities incorporate inductive thinking and the use of physical models and visual images to develop concepts and encourage higher-level reasoning. The Activity Approach can be packaged with Activity Sets that correspond to each section of the text and augment the ideas presented in the sections. Each Activity Set consists of a sequence of inductive activities and experiments that enable the student to build an understanding of mathematical ideas through the use of models and the discovery of patterns. In addition, over thirty Material Cards are included that complement the color cardstock materials in the Manipulative Kit. A section on Ideas for the Elementary Classroom at the end of each chapter includes a suggested Elementary-School Activity that has been adapted from one of the chapter&#39;s Activity Sets. Additionally, a companion text, Mathematics for Elementary Teachers: A Conceptual Approach, is also available from the Bennett, Burton, and Nelson team. Mathematics for Elementary Teachers: A Conceptual Approach can be used independently or along with Mathematics for Elementary Teachers: An Activity Approach.</p><p></p><h2>Sagittarius: Harness the Power of the Zodiac (astrology, star sign) (Seeing Stars)</h2><p>WILD CHILD, OPEN HEART.<br>RESTLESS SAGITTARIUS,<br>LIVE YOUR WANDERLUST.<br> <br>Who are you going to fall in love with next?

It is our hope that readers will come to associate the dictionary with thoroughness, comprehensiveness, and ease of use: find it here; find it now.<br> <br> A diverse group of 900 scholars from 40 countries have contributed 7100 fresh new articles with 8400 entries including persons, places, things, theological concepts, and much more. These contributors were selected by the editorial board for their expertise in their field and for the quality of their scholarship in publication. Special care was taken to select authors who could provide a variety of perspectives from different theological traditions (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish), diverse theological trajectory (conservative and liberal), and from the social locations of gender, ethnicity, and race. <br> <br> With inclusivity comes a certain amount of exclusivity: the contributors are instructed to keep in mind a particular audience &#x2013;&nbsp; the congregation. With every dictionary entry, authors seek to define their topics in such a way that the entries will be relevant and useful to pastors, rabbis,preachers, teachers, and students in preparing to serve the congregation in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Thus the dictionary tries to balance the best in contemporary scholarship with the perceived needs of the congregation.&nbsp; Theological content and thorough discussion of various interpretations is tailored for congregational use.&nbsp; <br> <br> Topics are listed in alphabetical order from A-Z and evenly divided among the five volumes. The main entry (in bold) includes a pronunciation guide. Hebrew and Greek origins of the entry follow, with transliteration. Longer articles contain an introduction that summarizes the topic and include a helpful outline to guide the reader. Articles conclude with a short bibliography and cross references to related articles. In each definition, authors strive to incorporate as many biblical instances of the term as possible in the given amount of space, and to discuss the theological, social, or ecclesial implications of the topic, so that the definitions are practical aids to the tasks of preaching, teaching, and study of the Bible.<br> <br> Readers who are trained in ancient languages will appreciate the discussion of Hebrew and Greek terms, while at the same time, readers who are not familiar with Hebrew or Greek should not have difficulty following the articles, because transliteration and complete definitions are used throughout.&nbsp; The editorial board elected to use the Society of Biblical Literature Handbook of Style as a guide and determined that the Hebrew would be transliterated in the Handbook's general-purpose style for ease of use by readers without formal training in the ancient languages.<br> <br> With the burgeoning use of the internet as a source of information, the unfortunate result can be scattered and uneven coverage of a given topic from unknown and unreliable sources.&nbsp; This dictionary seeks to provide a trusted resource containing comprehensive information based on widely accepted critical tools about a wide variety of topics &#x2013; all in one place &#x2013;&nbsp; with cross references to related materials and a searchable CD, so that long and frustrating web searches with unreliable results will no longer be necessary. </p> <p>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>Katharine Doob Sakenfeld is the William Albright Eisenberger Professor of Old Testament Literature and Exegesis at Princeton Theological Seminary.

Conn was tall and massively yet rangily built, with broad sloping shoulders, a mighty, hairy chest, and long heavily muscled arms. His features were in keeping with his bodily aspect - a strong stubborn jaw, low slanting forehead topped by a shock of tawny tousled hair which added to the wildness of his appearance, as did his cold blue eyes. Garments he wore none, except a loin cloth; his own wolfish ruggedness was protection enough against the weather, ordinarily. For he was a slave in an age when even the masters lived lives ferociously hard and hardening.<br><br>Now Conn faced his master, and flexing his mighty arms absently, asked: "What was it that the farers in the longship shouted to us this morning, when we were out in the fishing boat?"<br><br>"You heard them, did you not, fool?" harshly asked Wolfgar Snorri's son. "Can you not understand human speech? As the dragon-ship swept past the point, the Vikings shouted to me that there was a gathering of eagles on the east coast of that cursed Ireland - Brian Boru is moving against King Sitric of Dublin, and the word has gone to all the sea-farers to gather for the slaughter. This time the sea-kings will crush that doddering old fool and his naked kerns, once and for all. It shall be as it was in the days of Thorgils the Conqueror. Too long have the kings of Dublin borne the insolence of the western Gaels."<br><br>Conn nodded, slowly. "It was in my mind that that was the word the sea- wolves shouted, but I wished to hear it from your lips, because I am slow of comprehension sometimes."<br><br>Wolfgar Snorri's son scowled. Like the slave, the Norseman was a typical figure of his age - tall, massive, with fierce intolerant eyes and a heavy golden beard. A son of those fierce Vikings who conquered and settled in the Orkneys, he was a slayer and a plunderer, who lived like a petty king in his own steading and recognized no authority save his own. Even as he sat in the comparative safety of his own skalli- hall, he wore a pliant shirt of scale mail and was girt with a broad metal-buckled belt from which hung a long straight sword in a leather scabbard.<br><br>The thrall's eyes strayed covetously to the blade; he said: "There will be a noble splintering of spears when the Ard-righ of Erin meets the sea-kings. I should be among his weapon-men."<br><br>Wolfgar snorted in high disdain. "Your life would soon be parted from your body. The Vikings will take the heads of the Dalcassians to adorn their serpent-prows. As for you - why, you fool, Brian Boru would hang you to an oak limb were you to venture into his kingdom."<br><br>"He was wrathful when I broke the truce with Melaghlin and slew a man of Meath, it is true," admitted the big Gael frankly. "But though I was forced to flee from the land of my birth, I have no reason to love the Viking-folk. Thorwald Raven took me when I was weak from hunger and wounds - for the life of an outlaw is hard - and put this collar on my neck." The thrall touched a heavy copper ring which encircled his corded throat. "Then he sold me to you - "<br><br>"And cheated me," snarled the Norseman. "Why I have not cut the blood- eagle on your stubborn back long ago, I cannot understand."<br><br>"I've done the work of three men," answered the thrall boldly. "I have not been backward when the swords were singing. I have stood at your back and mowed down carles like wheat when you warred with your neighbors. And in return you have given me - crusts from your board, a bare earth floor to sleep upon, and deep scars in my back because I would not call you master or fight for you against my own people."<br><br>"Well, dog," growled the Norseman, angrily tugging at his golden beard, "do you want to be petted like a Saxon girl?"<br><br>"I want to be free," answered the thrall calmly. "I was not born into slavery - that's why you've never broken me. No man ever broke a kern born in the western hills. We are brothers to the eagle.<br><br>"Well, I've borne your abuse and waited because each time I was minded to take your throat between my fingers and crush out your black heart, the thought came to me that the time was not yet. If I escaped from you I would still be an outlaw. But now that the Gaels are gathering to war upon the foreigners, I see my way clearly enough. King Brian will need all the weapon-men he can muster; it is not likely he will hang me when I come to strike a blow for the clan. The time has come; I will kill you and take that sword - which was once the sword of King Murkertagh - and I will fare forth. I will go in your strongest fishing boat; it is no short voyage from Orkneyar to Erin and the sea is wild with the storms of spring, but better drown in a good effort than die under the lash of a pirate."<br><br>Wolfgar, during this speech, which the thrall had spoken as calmly as though discussing the crops or the weather, had sat gaping in dumbfounded amazement. Now he exclaimed: "You addle-witted fool! Are you yet to be taught I am not a man with whom to jest?"<br><br>"Here is no jest," answered Conn and Wolfgar suddenly read the fixed intent in the thrall's cold eyes.<br><br>"You Irish dog!" roared the Norseman, leaping in frantic haste from his bench. His sword flashed from its scabbard but in the same instant Conn, quick as a leaping tiger, snatched up a log of fire-wood and struck with all the ferocious power of his iron muscles. The crude weapon crushed Wolfgar Snorri's son's head like an egg-shell and the master of the steading fell like a slaughtered ox in a pool of his own blood.<br><br>Swiftly Conn bent and caught up the sword which had fallen from the nerveless hand; he tore off the belt that encircled the dead man's waist and buckled it about his own body. A quick glance about showed him the vast hall was empty; no one had seen the deed. Conn caught up a bear-skin at random, to serve as a cloak, and fled the skalli.<br><br>The big thrall knew his limitations; he realized that if anyone stopped him and questioned him concerning his possession of his master's sword and the blood on his hands, he could not reply with subtlety enough to allay suspicion. His only safety lay in swift flight, before the body was discovered.<br><br>Luck, so long a stranger to the giant Gael, at last favored him. No one saw him emerge from the skalli and run swiftly between the store- houses and stables, heading for the shore of the small bay on which the steading was situated. There was peace between the wolves of the Orkneys; vigilance was relaxed as the carles and their masters busied themselves at their various occupations.<br><br>Conn was beyond the cluster of log-built houses before someone spied and hailed him, in swift suspicion at his haste. When he did not stop, the carle who had hailed him shouted for his fellows and pursuit began, though they did not yet know the reason for his flight.<br><br>But his start was long; bent low in fear of arrows, he raced down the slight slope to the beach where lay the fishing boats. A single carle gaped at him stupidly as with swift strokes he stove in all but one.<br><br>"Aside, Hrut!" gasped the Gael, casting free the painter of the remaining boat and preparing to shove off. The pursuers were nearing fast.<br><br>"But you cannot put to sea now," protested the slow-witted carle. "A storm is brewing - and why do they shout at you - ? - "<br><br>He dropped like a log under the impact of Conn's left fist against his temple. Working with frantic haste the Gael pushed off and plied the oars mightily, as the yelling Orkneymen gained the beach. Arrows hissed about him and one ripped the skin on his shoulder, spattering blood. Then the rising wind caught the small sail and the tiny boat leaped like a spurred horse and went dancing swiftly across the white- capped waves.<br><br>"Aye," muttered Conn grimly, as he steered without a backward glance at his erstwhile masters who brandished their swords along the beach and howled fearful threats. "Aye - a storm is rising on Erin and red will be the spray of the gale!"<br>II<br><br>The Weregirl of Craglea<br>The spring gale had blown itself out. The sky smiled blue overhead and the sea lay placid as a pool, with only a few scattered bits of drift- wood along the beaches to give mute evidence of her treachery. Along the strand rode a lone horseman, his saffron cloak whipping out behind him, his yellow hair blowing about his face in the breeze. He was a young man, tall, fair and comely, and his garments and weapons were those of a chief.<br><br>And now he suddenly reined up so short that his spirited steed reared and snorted. From among the sand dunes had risen a man, tall and powerful, of wild shock-headed aspect, and naked but for a loin-cloth.<br><br>"Who are you to thus accost me?" demanded the horseman. "You who bear the sword of a chief, yet have the appearance of a masterless man, and wear the collar of a serf withal?"<br><br>"I am Conn, young sir," answered the wanderer. "Once an outlaw - once a thrall - always a man of King Brian's, whether he will or no. And I know you - you are Dunlang O'Hartigan, friend and companion-in-arms to Murrogh, son of Brian, prince of the Dalcassians."<br><br>"What do you here?"<br><br>"I came from Torka in the Orkneys in an open boat, flung down as a chip is thrown upon the tide. The gale took me in her fangs last night - by Crom, I know not why or how I am alive today! I only know that I fought the sea in the boat until the boat sank under my feet, and then fought her in her naked waves until I lost all consciousness. None could have been more surprized than I when I came to myself this dawn lying on the beach like a piece of driftwood, more dead than alive. I have lain in the sun since, trying to warm the cold tang of the sea out of my bones."<br><br>"By the saints, Conn," said Dunlang, "I like your spirit."<br><br>"I hope King Brian likes it as well," grunted the kern. "He has sworn to hang me on sight for a matter of blood-feud."<br><br>"Attach yourself to my train," answered Dunlang. "I will speak for you. King Brian has weightier matters upon his mind than a single man- killing. This very day the opposing hosts lie drawn up for the death- grip."<br><br>"Good," grunted Conn. "I feared I would not arrive in time - think you the spear-shattering will fall on the morrow?"<br><br>"Not by King Brian's will," said Dunlang. "He is loath to shed blood on Good Friday. But who knows but the heathen will come down on us?"<br><br>Conn laid a hand on Dunlang's stirrup-leather and strode beside him as the steed moved leisurely along.<br><br>"There is a notable gathering of weapon-men?"<br><br>"More than twenty thousand warriors on each side; the bay of Dublin is dark with the dragonships from the mouth of the Liffey to Edar. From the Orkneys comes Jarl Sigurd with his raven banner. From the Isle of Man comes Broder with twenty longships. From the Danelagh in England comes Prince Amlaff, son of the king of Norway, with two thousand armed men. From all lands held by the Gall, the hosts have gathered - from the Orkneys, the Shetlands, the Hebrides - from Scotland and England and Germany, as well as from Scandinavia.<br><br>"There are among them, our spies say, a thousand men armed in steel mail from crown to heel - Sigurd's men, and Broder's; these fight in a solid wedge and the Dalcassians may be hard put to break that iron wall. Yet, God willing, we shall prevail. Then among the chiefs there are, besides those I have named, Anrad, Hrafn the Red, Platt of Danemark, Thorstein and his comrade-in-arms, Asmund, and Thorwald Raven who calls himself Jarl of the Hebrides."<br><br>At that name Conn grinned savagely and fingered his copper collar.<br><br>"It is a great gathering if Sigurd and Broder come together."<br><br>"That was the doing of Gormlaith," answered Dunlang.<br><br>"Word had come to the Orkneys that Brian had divorced Kormlada," said Conn, unconsciously giving the queen her Norse name.<br><br>"Aye - and her heart is black with hate against him. Strange it is that a woman so fair of form and countenance should have the soul of a devil."<br><br>"That's God's truth, my lord. And what of her brother, Mailmora?"<br><br>"Who but he is the instigator of the whole war?" cried Dunlang angrily. "The hatred between him and Murrogh, so long smoldering, has at last burst into flame, firing the whole kingdom. Both were in the wrong; Murrogh perhaps more than Mailmora. Gormlaith goaded her brother on. I did not believe King Brian acted wisely when he gave honors to those he had once warred against. It was not well when he married Gormlaith and gave his daughter to Gormlaith's son, Sitric of Dublin. When he took Gormlaith into his palace, he took in the seeds of strife and hatred. She is a wanton; once she was the wife of Amlaff Cuaran, king of Dublin; then she was the wife of King Malachi of Meath, and he put her aside because of her wickedness."<br><br>"What of Melaghlin?" asked Conn.<br><br>"He seems to have forgotten the struggle in which Brian wrested the crown of Ireland from him," said Dunlang. "Together the two kings move against the Danes and the king of Leinster."<br><br>As they had conversed they had passed along the bare coast until they had come into a rough broken stretch of cliffs and boulders; and there they halted suddenly. On a boulder sat a girl, clad in a shimmering green garment whose pattern was so much like scales that for a bewildered instant Conn thought himself to be gazing on a mermaid come out of the deep.<br><br>"Eevin!" Dunlang swung down from his horse, tossing the reins to Conn, and advancing, took her small hands in his. "You sent for me and I have come - you have been weeping!"</p><h2>Smith Blue (Crab Orchard Series in Poetry)</h2><p><p>In <i>Smith Blue</i>, Camille T. Dungy offers a survival guide for the modern heart as she takes on twenty-first-century questions of love, loss, and nature. From a myriad of lenses, these poems examine the human capability for perseverance in the wake of heartbreak; the loss of beloved heroes and landscapes; and our determination in the face of everyday struggles. Dungy explores the dual nature of our presence on the planet, juxtaposing the devastation caused by human habitation with our own vulnerability to the capricious whims of our environment. In doing so, she reveals with fury and tenderness the countless ways in which we both create and are victims of catastrophe.<br><br>This searing collection delves into the most intimate transformations wrought by our ever-shifting personal, cultural, and physical terrains, each fraught with both disillusionment and hope. In the end, Dungy demonstrates how we are all intertwined, regardless of race or species, living and loving as best we are able in the shadows of both man-made and natural follies. <br><br>&nbsp;</p><b>Flight</b>It is the day after the leaves, when buckeyes,like a thousand thousand pendulums, clock trees,and squirrels, fat in their winter fur, chuckle hours,chortle days.&nbsp; It is the time for the parting of our ways.&nbsp;You slid into the summer of my sleeping, creptinto my lonely hours, ate the music of my dreams.You filled yourself with the treated sweet I offered,then shut your rolling eyes and stole my sleep.&nbsp;Came morning and me awake.&nbsp; Came morning.Awake, I walked twelve miles to the six-gun shop.On the way there I saw a bird-of-prayer all furled up by the river.I called to it.&nbsp; It would not unfold.&nbsp; On the way home I killed it.&nbsp;It is the time of the waking cold, when buckeyes,like a thousand thousand metronomes, tock time,and you, fat on my summer sleep, titter toward me,walk away.&nbsp; It is the time for the parting of our days.</p><p>Camille T. Dungy is the author of <i>What to Eat, What to Drink, What to Leave for Poison</i> and <i>Suck on the Marrow</i>.

She teaches at San Francisco State University."Exquisite moments of intimacy caught in the meshes of history, of human depredation registered in language as plainspoken as it is rich in implication, <i>Smith Blue</i> by Camille Dungy is a gorgeous and powerful book, one of the best I've read in recent years."-Alan Shapiro, author of <i>Old War&nbsp;<br></i><br>"These are large, open-hearted lyrics about love: its pleasure, its neglect, loss and remembrance. Love here is not just parental and fraternal or of lovers and husbands, but a love for butterflies, things and their places. With a subtle variety yet balance of line, these are not ponderous pronouncements, but the voice of a graceful wondering about the world and the way we carry on."-Ed Roberson, author of <i>City Eclogue&nbsp;<br><br></i>"Loss inhabits these poems-palpable, less spiritual than common though no less devastating, spoken by one not afraid 'to hear what quiet really sounds like.' And what has been lost?- lovers, landscapes, poets, none replaceable with the easy distractions of iPods or NPR. What remains? Words. Lyrically adept yet coolly self-conscious, these poems engage loss to 'recall / how we smelled before this end was begun.'"-Michael Waters, author of <i>Darling Vulgarity</i>, finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize</p><h2>Battlefield of the Mind Study Guide: Winning The Battle in Your Mind</h2><p><b>The newly updated edition of the study guide companion to Joyce Meyer's bestselling book of all time, <i>Battlefield of the Mind</i>.</b><br>Thoughts affect every aspect of our lives, and that's why it's so important to be in control of them.

International in its coverage, these volumes depart from the established poetic modes that grew out of the nineteenth century and instead bring together the movements that radically altered the ways that art and language express the human condition.<br><br>The first volume offers three "galleries" of individual poets&#x2015;figures such as Mallarm�, Stein, Rilke, Tzara, Mayakovsky, Pound, H.D., Vallejo, Artaud, C�saire, and Tsvetayeva. Included, too, are sections dedicated to some of the most significant pre-World War II movements in poetry and the other arts: Futurism, Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism, Objectivism, and Negritude. The second volume will extend the gathering to the present, forming a synthesizing, global anthology that surpasses other collections in its international scope and experimental range.<br><br>Poet-editors Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris provide informative and irreverent commentaries throughout. They challenge old truths and propose alternative directions, in the tradition of the revolutionary manifestos that have marked the art and poetry of the twentieth century. The result is both an essential source book for experiencing the full range of this century's poetic possibilities and a powerful statement on the future of poetry in the millennium ahead.</p><p>"The word 'anthology' hardly does justice to Rothenberg and Joris's brilliant reconceptualization of twentieth-century poetry in a global context. This is that rare book that forces us to rethink what the poetic is and can be."&#x2015;Marjorie Perloff<br><br>"This book is destined to become a fundamental resource for the study of twentieth-century literature and culture. Its importance cannot be overstated."&#x2015;Charles Bernstein<br><br>"A much broader, much more intelligent sweep, this anthology, than most."&#x2015;Amiri Baraka<br><br>"A riveting literary achievement of phenomenal scope and generosity. Kudos to Rothenberg and Joris for their passionate, discerning editorship, spanning cultures, sensibilities, and languages. This illuminating compendium displays the best of humanity's bardic inheritance and vision. It should be obligatory reading for all scholars, students, writers and lovers of poetry. May the wisdom in these poems benefit us all."&#x2015;Anne Waldman, Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, The Naropa Institute<br><br>"Looking back from this end of the century we can begin to see how partial our views of its literary happenings have been: how time-bound, tongue-bound, often celebrity-bound. In an accurately titled <i>Poems for the Millennium</i> we can at last sense the scope of the Revolution of the Word that's been in process since&#x2015;oh, 1895. There's no other anthology like this one, no other overview so venturesome."&#x2015;Hugh Kenner<br><br>"This is not like any other anthology, not a collection of excellences, no absurd imitations of a canon. It's more like a Handbook of Inventors and Inventions, or of Explorers and Discoveries, that opens up all sorts of pathways for poetry from its past and future to a living present. A truly international book of modern poetry that exceeds its claims to move from the <i>fin de si�cle</i> to the poets of <i>Negritude,</i> as it crosses frontiers of language and culture and genre. This may be the only collection of modernist poetry that reveals its simultaneous connections to an archaic and ecological past as well as a technological future, as it also wipes out rigid distinctions between poets and painters and sculptors and performers. It is above all a book of possibilities and invitations.&#x2015;David Antin<br><br>"The intermingling circles of poetries and cultures move outward to continents and also open up to all times. True cosmopolitanism loves the specifics of little places and small societies&#x2015;just the right gesture, the precise quaver of the voice, the exact variety of maize. Rothenberg and Joris's anthology gives us, by virtue of its organic structure and inspired choices, the possibility of a kind of situated internationalism, what 'modernism' half wanted to become. This is a presentation of a poetics that is already here, but imperfectly recognized. It is a sourcebook for the future."&#x2015;Gary Snyder<b>Jerome Rothenberg</b> is a poet and one of the world's leading anthologists.

As a musician he organized the International Festival of Baroque Opera and Theatre at Versailles in the early 1990s, and thus was instrumental in the rediscovery of much forgotten classical music. Yet in 1994 he abruptly renounced all musical activities. <i>The Hatred of Music</i> is Quignard&#x2019;s masterful exploration of the power of music and what history reveals about the dangers it poses.<br> &nbsp;<br> From prehistoric chants to challenging contemporary compositions, Quignard reflects on music of all kinds and eras. He draws on vast cultural knowledge&#x2014;the Bible, Greek mythology, early modern history, modern philosophy, the Holocaust, and more&#x2014;to develop ten accessible treatises on music. In each of these small masterpieces the author exposes music&#x2019;s potential to manipulate, to mesmerize, to domesticate. Especially disturbing is his scrutiny of the role music played in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Quignard&#x2019;s provocative book takes on particular relevance today, as we find ourselves surrounded by music as never before in history.</p><p><b>Pascal Quignard </b>is a French novelist, essayist, critic, translator, and former musician. He is the author of more than sixty books and in 2002 won the Prix Goncourt, France&#x2019;s top literary prize, for his genre-defying <i>The Roving Shadows</i>.

I can&#x2019;t deny the depth of his thinking, to say nothing of his gift for aphorism . . .

It hovers in a peculiarly French space between philosophy and fiction, and goes on mysterious lyrical flights, animating scenes from history and myth. . . .

The text emphasizes common sense and common knowledge in approaching real problems through popular news items and finding useful mathematical tools and frames with which to address those questions. We asked ourselves what we hoped our students would remember about this course in ten years&#39; time. From that ten year perspective, thoughts about syllabus -- &#34;&#34;what topics should we cover?&#34;&#34; -- seemed much too narrow. What matters more is our wish to change the way our students&#39; minds work the way they approach a problem, or, more generally, the way they approach the world. Most people skip the numbers in newspapers, magazines, on the web, and, more importantly, even in financial information. We hope that in ten years our students will follow the news, confident in their ability to make sense of the numbers they find there and in their daily lives. Most quantitative reasoning texts are arranged by mathematical topics to be mastered. Since the mathematics is only a part of what we hope students learn, we&#39;ve chosen another strategy. We look at real life stories that can be best understood with careful reading and a little mathematics.</p><p>Ten years on, students will benefit more from the ability to approach problems rather than the specific mathematics courses they studied at school. Addressing real-life problems which can be understood with common sense and a little mathematics, this book provides students with tools they can take beyond the classroom.Ethan D.

Recent decades have seen the publication of American histories that are either bloated with unnecessary detail or infused with a polemical purpose that undermines their authority. In<em>Twentieth-Century America</em>, Thomas C. Reeves provides a fluidly written narrative history that combines the rare virtues of compression, inclusiveness, and balance.<br> From Progressivism and the New Deal right up to the present, Reeves covers all aspects of American history, providing solid coverage of each era without burying readers in needless detail or trivia. This approach allows readers to grasp the major developments and continuities of American history and to come away with a cohesive picture of the whole of the twentieth century. The volume stresses social and well as political history, emphasizing the roles played by <em>all</em> Americans--including immigrants, minorities, women, and working people--and pays special attention to such topics as religion, crime, public health, national prosperity, and the media. Reeves is careful throughout to present both sides of controversial subjects and yet does not leave readers bewildered about which interpretations are most strongly supported or where to explore these issues more thoroughly. At the conclusion of each chapter, the author cites ten authoritative volumes for further study. The bibliographies, as well as the text, are refreshing in their lack of ideological bent. "Objectivity," Reeves suggests, "is an illusive but worthy goal for the historian."<br> For anyone wishing to achieve a lucid historical overview of the past 100 years, <em>Twentieth-Century America</em> is the best place to start.</p><p><br><strong>Thomas C. Reeves</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside and Senior Fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Institute. The author of <em>The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy</em> and the best-selling <em>A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy</em>, he lives in Franksville, Wisconsin.<br>From the author of The Empty Church (1996) comes another ideology-saturated piece of propaganda masquerading as history. Twentieth-Century America claims to be a college textbook, but it is really a lament about the crumbling of traditional values. In a chapter called The Best Years, Reeves declares that to a great many Americans who lived through them, the years 1953 to 1963 were an especially pleasant time in this countrys history. Before we can suggest that Betty Friedan (not to mention Rosa Parks) might take issue with his description of life under Eisenhower, Reeves quotes a 1995 journalists assertion that elderly women who were young mothers in the suburbs during the `50s would tell you those were the best years they can remember. His portrait of the centurys close is revealing: He crows about the collapse of welfare as we know it, and wonders where have all the morals gone. Reeves relies entirely on the work of William Raspberry and Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom when discussing African-Americans in the `90s, and he is more concerned with black participation in the sports stadium than in the voting booth (the large photograph of Michael Jordan will tell you youre on the right page). The erosion of Christendom is a favorite theme, and in the final chapter Reeves proclaims that the courts, in the name of the separation of church and state, were a major force in restricting the impact of the Christian faith. Among other things, they outlawed prayer in the public schools and drove Christian symbols out of public places. The highly influential New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, applauded these rulings. Somehow, Reeves neglects to mention that the NYTs and the ACLUs applause was part of an international Jewish plot. If you want to learn about contemporary cultural conservatism, start here; if youre interested in the nations past, skip Twentieth-Century America.

Continuing in the spirit of the other books in this series, Old Testament Figures in Art compiles entries on key figures and events in the Old Testament, beginning with the Pentateuch, then drawing from the historical books, the books of wisdom and poetry, and, finally, the prophetic books.<br>The vivid illustrations depict Old Testament scenes that occur most frequently as iconographic prototypes in Western art. Among the masterpieces featured are <em>The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark</em> by Jan Brueghel the Elder, <em>The Sacrifice of Isaac</em> by Rembrandt, <em>Samson and Delilah</em> by Peter Paul Rubens, <em>Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</em> by Paul Gauguin, and <em>Isaac Receiving Rebekah as His Wife</em> by Marc Chagall.<br> The accompanying texts illuminate the unique ways in which Old Testament subjects have been portrayed in Western art throughout the ages. To complement the many scriptural references, this handy volume also offers comparisons with other cultures whose stories or myths parallel those represented in the book.</p><p><br><strong>Chiara de Capoa</strong> is an art historian specializing in medieval art at the Libera Universit� di Lingua e Communicazione IULM in Milan.<br></p><h2>Systematic Theology, Volume 2: The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: Processions and Persons</h2><p><p>Katherine Sonderegger follows her monumental volume on the doctrine of God with this second entry of her <i>Systematic Theology</i>, which explores the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. Locating her analysis first in the Hebrew Scriptures, Sonderegger examines the thrice-holy God that is proclaimed to Isaiah in the sanctuary and manifested in the sacrifice of the temple. The book of Leviticus, read in conversation with Exodus, unfolds the doctrine of the Trinity under the character of holiness. In the One God, Trinity speaks of the life, movement, and self-offering of God, who is the eternal procession of goodness and light. In Israel's sacrificial covenant, the Triune God is perfect self-offering: the eternal descent of the Father of Lights is the offering who is Son, eternally received and hallowed in the one who is Spirit. Anchoring the theology of the Trinity in Israel's Scriptures in this way elevates the processions over the persons, exploring the mystery of the Divine Life as holy, rational, and good. The Divine Persons, named in the New Testament, cannot be defined but may be glimpsed in the notion of perfection, a complete and perfect infinite set. In all these ways, the Holy Trinity may be praised as the deep reality of the life of God.</p></p><p><p><b>Katherine Sonderegger</b> is the William Meade Professor of Theology at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia.

Kover. Filled with intrigue, romance, and deadly vengeance, <i>Georges</i> is the story of a wealthy mulatto boy who is driven from his island home by racist landowners. Returning to Mauritius as an accomplished young man, Georges pits his strength against a powerful plantation owner, leading a dramatic slave uprising and claiming the heart of a beautiful white woman. <i>Georges</i> stands apart as the only book by Dumas that explores the potent subject of race. <br><br>Praise for <i>Georges:</i><br><br>&#x201c;A rousing and vivid adventure . . . packed with action and atmosphere.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Columbus Dispatch<br></i><br>&#x201c;A remarkable discovery . . .

Somewhere fresh and carpeted in green, where you could lie in the shade of a riverside palm tree and doze off without a care in the world?<br><br>Well, the paradise of your dreams exists! Eden awaits you; the water flows clear and bright there, falling and surging up in bright dust; the palm fronds wave gently in the soft sea breeze like feathers in a genie&#x2019;s cap. The jambosa trees, laden with iridescent fruit, stand ready to offer you their sweetly scented shade. Come, follow me now.<br><br>Let us make for Brest, warlike sister of bustling Marseille, standing sentinel over the waves. Choose a vessel from the hundreds anchored in its port&#x2014;perhaps a brigantine, long-masted, lean, and light-sailed, fit even for the hardy pirates dreamed up by Walter Scott, that romantic poet of the waves. It&#x2019;s early September, the perfect time to begin a long voyage. Let us board our chosen ship and leave summer behind in our quest for spring! Adieu, Brest, Nantes, Bayonne&#x2014;adieu, France!<br><br>See there, on our right, that granite peak towering ten thousand feet into the clouds? Look, in such transparent water even its mighty roots are visible. It is Tenerife, the ancient Nivaria, rendezvous point for the eagles that swoop and glide around its crest, looking as small as doves from this great distance. This, however, is not our destination; it&#x2019;s simply a stray bit of Spain, and I&#x2019;ve promised you the garden of the world.<br><br>Look, on the left&#x2014;that barren rock, burning in the tropical sun? Our modern Prometheus spent six years chained there. England chose that wasted islet to erect a monument to its own shame, to the stake where Joan of Arc burned and the scaffold where Mary Stuart died. It is a political Golgotha, and for eighteen years it was the pious rendezvous point where all ships converged. But&#x2014;enough of the regicide St. Helena, we will have nothing more to do with her, now that the martyr is gone.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve reached the Cape of Storms now. See the towering peak in front of us, its summit lost in the mists? This is the giant Adamastor, who appeared to the author of The Lusiads. It marks the very end of the earth&#x2014;the prow of that great green vessel on which we are all passengers. How the waves crash with furious impotence against its rocky face! It is impervious, invincible, forever anchored here in the port of eternity with God himself as captain. Let us keep on. Beyond these verdant mountains lies nothing but barren stone and sun-scorched desert. I promised you pure water, gentle shade, succulent fruit, and radiant blooms, did I not?<br><br>Ah, the westerly wind has finally brought us to our destination&#x2014;the Indian Ocean, theater of the Arabian Nights! There is grim Mont Bourbon, with its sulfurous, eternally flaming volcano. Spare a glance at its fiery maw and smell its fumes. Just a few knots more now; we pass between �le Plate and Coin-de-Mire and round pointe aux Cannoniers, and we drop anchor at last. Our trusty brigantine has earned a rest. We have arrived! This is the blessed island itself, hidden away in this far-flung corner of the world like some virginal maiden whose mother jealously guards her beauty from covetous suitors&#x2019; eyes. This is the Promised Land&#x2014;the pearl of the Indian Ocean. This is �le de France.<br><br>Now, chaste daughter of the seas, twin sister of Bourbon, blessed rival of Ceylon, let me raise a corner of your veil so that I may introduce you to a foreign friend, my fellow traveler here. Let me just loosen your sash&#x2014;there! Ah, beautiful captive! We are two poor pilgrims from France&#x2014;France, who will, perhaps, arrive one day to reclaim you at last, rich daughter of India, for the bride-price of some poor European realm . . .<br><br>As for you, dear readers, who have followed our eyes and our thoughts this far, let me bid you a very hearty welcome to this land of fertile fields, bountiful harvests, and endless springs and summers bursting with flowers and fruit. Let me wax poetic for a moment and tell you of the wonders of this place. It is a veritable Aphrodite, born of sea foam to reign over a celestial empire, her toes in the sea and her head in the clouds, crowned with golden days and crystalline nights, eternal jewels gifted by God himself&#x2014;which the English have never yet managed to take from her. Come, then&#x2014;air travel doesn&#x2019;t bother you any more than sea travel, does it? Good! Grab hold of my coattails, then, you new Cl�ofas, and fly with me to the peak of Pieterboot, almost the highest mountain on the island. We can see everything from there!<br><br>The sky is always clear, as you see, and thickly clustered with stars; it is a blue carpet where God left behind gold dust in each of his footsteps, and where each atom is a world in itself. The whole island is laid out at our feet like an enormous map, 145 leagues around. Its sixty rivers look like silver threads winding their way to the sea, and its thirty mountains are thickly forested with takamaka, palm, and basket trees. See, among all those rivers, the great waterfalls of le R�duit and la Fontaine, rushing wildly from deep in the woods to crash thunderously into the ocean below&#x2014;the mighty ocean that, calm or stormy, will always defeat the fury of the cascades. There, too, is the mighty rivi�re Noire, flowing majestically, shaping everything in its path and showing how time and tranquility always conquer unbridled rage. Gloomy Brabant stands among the other peaks like a giant sentinel keeping watch for enemy attacks. There is the crest of Trois-Mamelles, around whose base curl the Tamarin and Rempart rivers, as if the Indian goddess Isis wished to leave her mark. Gaze, finally, at the towering summit of le Pouce, near Pieterboot, for it is the highest point on the island; it seems to touch the very heavens, reminding us of the celestial court that will eventually render judgment on us all.<br><br>Before us is Port Louis, formerly Port Napoleon, the island&#x2019;s capital city, protected from invaders by �le des Tonneliers. See its many wooden houses and the two rivers running among them, which turn into veritable torrents after every storm. Its population holds a sample of every race of Earth. There are Creoles being carried about in palanquins, so indolent that their slaves are trained to respond to gestures rather than words; then there are the blacks, for whom the sun rises and sets by the lash of a whip. Falling somewhere between these two extremes are the Lascars, faces tanned under their green and red turbans. There are the Yoloffs of Senegambia, tall and handsome, with skin dark as ebony, sparkling eyes, and teeth like pearls; there are the short Chinese, flat-chested and wide-shouldered, with their bare heads and drooping mustaches. No one understands their language, yet they are masters of trade; there is no profession they do not practice; no merchandise they do not sell; no service they will not provide. They are the Jews of the colony. Gaze at the Malays, small, cunning, copper-skinned, and vindictive, who will forget a kindness in the blink of an eye but bear a grudge forever; the gentle giants of Mozambique; the Malgaches, slim, ruddy, and clever; the tall, proud Namaquois, trained to hunt tigers and elephants from earliest childhood. And there, in the midst of this teeming mass of humanity, are the English officers stationed on the island or in the port, proud in their scarlet jackets, black helmets, and white trousers. They look around them with supreme disdain, dismissing Creole and mulatto, master and slave, native and colonist with equal scorn; they speak only of London, of dear old England, and of themselves.<br><br>Behind us bustles Grand Port, formerly Port Imperial, established originally by the Dutch and then abandoned, for the same strong breezes that bring vessels so easily into the harbor too often prevent them from leaving as well. After years of neglect and decay, it is only today that houses are beginning to rise anew from the old ruins&#x2014;a town once more, with a bay in which schooners seek refuge from pirates against a backdrop of green-forested hills where slaves hide from their tyrannical masters. Just behind those emerald peaks, almost under our very feet, you will find the region of Moka, lying on the slopes that face away from the port, perfumed with the scents of aloe, pomegranates, and cassis. It is a garden within a garden, the garden of the world; always festive and beautiful, the most breathtaking spot on the island.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s face Madagascar again. To our left, beyond le R�duit, are the beautiful plains of Williams and Saint-Pierre, then Moka, the loveliest part of the island, divided by the rounded bulk of Mont Corps-de-Garde, shaped like a horse&#x2019;s rump. Farther on, past the Great Woods, is the savanna, with its winding rivers called Citronniers, Bain-de-N�gresses, and l&#x2019;Arcade, and its well-defended port, so perfectly protected by steep hills that only friends may enter. Its pastures are as fertile as those of the Saint-Pierre Plains, its soil as virgin and untouched as that of the American wilderness. Farther inland there is an enormous lake filled with moray eels large and savage enough to devour live deer and even runaway slaves foolish enough to attempt a swim.<br><br>Finally, we turn to our right. Here is the Rempart district, dominated by the peak of Mont D�couverte, beyond whose summit the ships&#x2019; masts rise like so many delicate willow branches. There are Cape Malheureux, the Bay of Tombeaux, and the Church of Pamplemousses. Here, too, are the two side-by-side huts of Madame de la Tour and Marguerite. It was at Cape Malheureux where the Saint-G�ran sank, and in the Bay of Tombeaux that the corpse of a young woman was found, a torn portrait clutched in her hand. She was laid to rest in the Church of Pamplemousses, and just two months later a boy of the same age was buried beside her. You may have already guessed it: They were the tragic young Paul and Virginie, star-crossed tropical lovers buried in a single crypt, whose deaths are still mourned in the sighing rise and fall of the waves as a tigress might mourn the cubs she herself destroyed in a momentary fit of rage or jealousy.<br><br>So! Now that I have acquainted you with our fair island, with her inlets and shores, her rivers and hills, you may go wherever you like, day or night&#x2014;to the �le de la passe de Descorne in the southwest, or to Mahebourg on Petit-Malabar; along the coasts or deep in the interior; you may swim the rivers or climb the mountains, or watch the blazing disk of the setting sun light up the plains as if they were afire or the moon cast her melancholy light on the peaks, and if you are lulled by the afternoon heat, the Chinese rose water, or the Spanish jasmine, if you feel as lazy as if you had taken opium, you may stretch yourself on the soft green grass and abandon yourself without fear to the voluptous pleasures of sleep. If you are wakened, though, by a gentle rustle of leaves, be assured that it&#x2019;s no Jamaican beast nor Bengal tiger; there are no reptilian hisses to be heard on �le de France, nor the nocturnal roars of any predatory animals. No; it is only a bright-eyed young black girl gazing curiously through the bamboo stalks at this new European visitor. Simply smile at her and she will gather you a feast of ripe bananas, mangoes, and tamarinds. Say but one word to her, and she will reply, in her low and wistful voice, &#x201c;I slave; I do what you want.&#x201d; Shining with pride and satisfaction at your kind looks or tolerant words, she will refuse all pay and offer to lead you to her master&#x2019;s house. Follow her down a tree-lined avenue to a pretty home with a flower-filled garden. Here lives the planter&#x2014;he may be a benevolent father to his slaves or he may be a tyrant, but then, that has nothing to do with you. Enter and sit at the family table, and you&#x2014;the honored guest&#x2014;will be served from dishes of fine china and goblets of clearest crystal, endlessly refilled with the island&#x2019;s best ale. Hunt in your host&#x2019;s fields as much as you like; fish in his rivers; dine on his fattest calf. Here, the arrival of a guest is cause for celebration, like the return of a prodigal son to Paradise.<br><br>The English have long coveted this beloved daughter of France. They have hovered around her, attempting to seduce her first with rich gifts, then threats, and finally by force. She met every approach with supreme disdain, this lovely Creole of ours; she acquitted herself so well, in fact, that the men who desired her were so anxious to possess her that she had to be guarded as one might keep watch over a fragile Spanish nun. For a time it seemed that she would be left in peace, that she would be able to fend off any aggressors&#x2014;but England launched a final, impassioned attack, and one morning �le de France learned the terrible news that her sister island Bourbon had been taken. Sharpening their knives and polishing their guns, the defenders waited for the enemy to appear&#x2014;and on August 23, 1810, accompanied by the deafening thunder of cannon fire, they came.</p><h2>All God&#39;s Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw</h2><p><i>All God's Dangers</i> won the National Book Award in 1975.<br><br> "On a cold January morning in 1969, a young white graduate student from Massachusetts, stumbling along the dim trail of a long-defunct radical organization of the 1930s, the Alabama Sharecropper Union, heard that there was a survivor and went looking for him. In a rural settlement 20 miles or so from Tuskegee in east-central Alabama he found him&#x2014;the man he calls Nate Shaw&#x2014;a black man, 84 years old, in full possession of every moment of his life and every facet of its meaning. . . . Theodore Rosengarten, the student, had found a black Homer, bursting with his black Odyssey and able to tell it with awesome intellectual power, with passion, with the almost frightening power of memory in a man who could neither read nor write but who sensed that the substance of his own life, and a million other black lives like his, were the very fiber of the nation's history." &#x2014;H. Jack Geiger, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Extraordinarily rich and compelling.&#34;--The Washington PostNate Shaw&#39;s father was born under slavery. Nate Shaw was born into a bondage that was only a little gentler. At the age of nine, he was picking cotton for thirty-five cents an hour. At the age of forty-seven, he faced down a crowd of white deputies who had come to confiscate a neighbor&#39;s crop. His defiance cost him twelve years in prison. This triumphant autobiography, assembled from the eighty-four-year-old Shaw&#39;s oral reminiscences, is the plain-spoken story of an &#34;over-average&#34; man who witnessed wrenching changes in the lives of Southern black people -- and whose unassuming courage helped bring those changes about.</p><h2>Handbook of Psychological Assessment</h2><p><b>The most highly acclaimed and complete reference work on psychological assessment-fully updated and expanded</b> <p>Covering principles of assessment, evaluation, referral, treatment planning, and report writing, the latest edition of Gary Groth-Marnat's landmark <i>Handbook of Psychological Assessment</i> has been thoroughly revised and expanded.

Bernstein, who chronicled the evolution of risk in his recent bestseller, Against the Gods, tells the story of history's most coveted, celebrated, and inglorious asset: gold. From the ancient fascinations of Moses and Midas through the modern convulsions caused by the gold standard and its aftermath, gold has led many of its most eager and proud possessors to a bad end. Gold had them, rather than the other way around. And while the same cycle of obsession and desperation may reverberate in today's fast-moving, electronically-driven stock markets, the role of gold in shaping human history is the striking feature of this tumultuous tale. Such is the power of gold. <p>This fascinating account begins with the magical, religious, and artistic qualities of gold and progresses to the invention of coinage, the transformation of gold into money, and the gold standard. The more important gold becomes as money, the more loudly it speaks of power--even more loudly than when it served as an entry to Heaven or a symbol of omnipotence. Ultimately, the book confronts the future of gold in a world where it appears to have been relegated to the periphery of global finance.</p> <p>From the Bible to the Gold Rush era to modern day Fort Knox and beyond, unforgettable characters stride through these pages. Contemplate gold from the diverse perspectives of monarchs and moneyers, potentates and politicians, men of legendary wealth and others of more plebeian beginnings; from Asia Minor's King Croesus to Rome's noted speculator Crassus, to Byzantine emperors and humble miners, Venice's Marco Polo and Spain's Francisco Pizarro, to Charlemagne and Charles de Gaulle, Richard I and Richard Nixon, Isaac Newton and Winston Churchill, Britain's economists David Ricardo and John Maynard Keynes, and Christopher Columbus and the Forty-Niners. Perhaps most remarkable are the frantic speculators who pushed gold to $850.00 an ounce in 1980 just as their counterparts twenty years later drove Internet stocks to exorbitant heights.</p> <p>Whether it is Egyptian pharaohs with depraved tastes, the luxury-mad survivors of the Black Death, the Chinese inventor of paper money, the pirates on the Spanish Main, or the hardnosed believers in the international gold standard like the United States' President Herbert Hoover, gold has been the supreme possession. It has been an icon for greed and an emblem of rectitude, as well as a vehicle for vanity and a badge of power that has shaped the destiny of humanity through the ages. As Bernstein muses, "The joke is that nothing is as useless and useful all at the same time."</p> <p>Far more than a tale of romantic myths, daring explorations, and the history of money and power struggles, <b><i>The Power of Gold</i></b> suggests that the true significance of this infamous element may lie in the timeless passions it continues to evoke, and what this reveals about ourselves.</p></p><p>In the first chapter of his book <i>The Power of Gold</i>, Peter Bernstein quotes the immortal words of King Ferdinand of Spain, who once declared: "Get gold, humanely if possible, but at all hazards--get gold." As ensuing chapters reveal, man's obsession with finding, keeping, selling, and evaluating gold has rarely been a humane adventure and has always been a hazardous one. Digging deeply into history's treasury of torrid tales and complicated deals, Bernstein examines gold's lure with an economist's passion for quantification, a historian's eye for detail, and a sociologist's feel for its consequence.<p> Useless as a metal for most practical purposes, gold originally held value as decoration and adornment for the wealthy ancients. Later, it was minted and used as coins by the Lydians in 635 B.C. That, Bernstein goes on to reveal, put gold on a path from the concrete to the abstract, from evidence of wealth to the standard behind wealth in other forms, and finally to the tenuous place it holds in today's virtual world of credit cards and computer chips. Along the way lie wild stories of lives destroyed, fortunes won and quickly lost, and values transformed: the massacre by the Spanish invader Pizarro, whose small band of men decimated the formidable army of Emperor Atahualpa, "the Inca," through more duplicity than military skill; the roller-coaster ride of the 1890s, when the rippling impact of the Baring Brothers bank crisis in Britain sent the isolated United States into an economic meltdown; and the surplus of the Gold Coast natives of Timbuktu, who willingly traded their gold for much-needed salt, ounce for ounce.</p><p> Bernstein is a great storyteller. His accounts of mythological, ancient, and recent history ooze with odd and entertaining details that bring each successive tale of obsession to life. If not for his skill, the sheer volume of events collected here--presented more anecdotally than systematically--would be overwhelming. In the end, though, it is Bernstein's fascination with the power of gold to entangle and entrap its possessors, and its ultimate ability to change the course of entire eras and civilizations, that makes his book as fascinating as it is informative. A dense but entertaining read. --<i>S. Ketchum</i></p>"Bernstein...gives us a multifaceted depiction of the powerful pull gold has...his grasp on things financial...is firm, and he's admirably adept at explaining them."

A strong advocate of cultural conservatism, Weaver (1910-1953) argued strongly for the role of liberal studies in the face of what he saw as the encroachments of modern scientific and technological forces in society. He was particularly opposed to sociology. In rhetoric he drew many of his ideas from Plato, especially his <i>Phaedrus.</i> <br> <br> As a result, all the main strands of Weaver's thought can be seen in this volume, beginning with his essay on the <i>Phaedrus</i> and proceeding through his discussion of evolution in the 1925 Scopes "Monkey Trial." In addition, this book includes studies of Lincoln, Burke, and Milton, and remarks about sociology and some proposals for modern rhetoric. Each essay poses issues still under discussion today.<br></p><p>Richard M. Weaver (1910 63) was an American scholar, revered twentieth-century conservative, and professor of English and rhetoric at the University of Chicago. He is the author of several books, including &#34;The Ethics of Rhetoric&#34; and &#34;Visions of Order: The Cultural Crisis of Our Time.&#34;</p><h2>McDougal Littell Language of Literature: Student Edition Grade 9 2006</h2><p>The Language of Literature [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Essentials of Managed Health Care</h2><p>As the most widely-used textbook on managed care, Essentials of Managed Health Care provides an authoritative and comprehensive overview of the key strategic, tactical, and operational aspects of managed health care and health insurance.

Frank Wilczek has played a lead role in establishing the new paradigms. Transcending the clash and mismatch of older ideas about what matter is, and what space is, Wilczek presents here some brilliant and clear syntheses. Space is a dynamic material, the engine of reality; matter is a subtle pattern of disturbance in that material.<p>Extraordinarily readable and authoritative, <i>The Lightness of Being</i> is the first book to unwrap these exciting new ideas for the general public. It explores their implications for basic questions about space, mass, energy, and the longed-for possibility of a fully unified theory of Nature. Along the way, Wilczek presents new perspectives on many strange aspects of our fantastic universe. Pointing toward new directions where the great discoveries in fundamental physics are likely to come, he envisions a new Golden Age in physics.</p></p><p><b>Frank Wilczek</b> won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 for work that he did as a twenty-one-year-old graduate student. His 1989 book, <i>Longing for the Harmonies</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. Wilczek's work has been anthologized in <i>Best American Science Writing</i> and <i>The Norton Anthology of Light Verse</i>. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is currently the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at MIT.Grand unification theories have long been a holy grail in science. Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning physicist Wilczek, who has himself made notable contributions in this field, offers a survey of everything in the universe from quarks to black holes, elucidating the current scientific thinking on how matter and energy interact. The two main concepts are the Grid and the Core. Wilczek says the grid is a conceptual descendant of ether, that mysterious substance scientists once believed filled empty space. Now some physicists theorize that space is highly structured by the grid, which is the primary ingredient of physical reality and the substance from which all physical matter is formed. Core theory, on the other hand, provides a theory of everything, reconciling gravity with electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Wilczek reports a couple of problems with core theory: it's not very elegant (scientists love elegance in their equations), and it hasn't been reconciled with string theory. This book is not for most general readers, but will be a hit with hard-core science buffs. Photos, illus. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We made a small patterned book about one of the stuffed animals in the classroom.&nbsp; I wrote some of the words and the students supplied the others, and I duplicated copies of the book for each child.&nbsp; We practiced reading it until everyone memorized our little book.&nbsp; The children proudly took their books home to read to their parents. I&#x2019;ve never forgotten that child&#x2019;s comment and what it taught me:&nbsp; Teachers must understand their students and meet their expectations.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first few years of teaching left me with more questions than answers, and I wanted to become a more effective teacher so I started taking graduate courses.&nbsp; In time I earned a master&#x2019;s degree and then a doctorate in Reading/Language Arts, both from Virginia Tech.&nbsp; Through my graduate studies, I learned a lot of answers, but more importantly, I learned to keep on asking questions.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I began teaching at the university level.&nbsp; First I taught at Miami University in Ohio, then at the University of Oklahoma, and finally at California State University, Fresno.

K. Ching. Each page has been meticulously revised to incorporate contemporary examples of the principles of form, space, and order-the fundamental vocabulary of every designer. The result is a beautifully illustrated volume that embraces today&#39;s forms and looks at conventional models with a fresh perspective. Here, Ching examines every principal of architecture, juxtaposing images that span centuries and cross cultural boundaries to create a design vocabulary that is both elemental and timeless. Among the topics covered are point, line, plane, volume, proportion, scale, circulation, and the interdependence of form and space. While this revision continues to be a comprehensive primer on the ways form and space are interrelated and organized in the shaping of our environment, it has been refined to amplify and clarify concepts. In addition, the Second Edition contains: * Numerous new hand-rendered drawings * Expanded sections on openings and scale * Expanded chapter on design principles * New glossary and index categorized by the author * New 8 1/2 11 upright trim In the Second Edition of Architecture: Form, Space, and Order, the author has opted for a larger format and crisper images. Mr. Ching has retained the style of his hand-lettered text, a hallmark of each of his books. This rich source of architectural prototypes, each rendered in Mr. Ching&#39;s signature style, also serves as a guide to architectural drawing. Doubtless, many will want this handsome volume for the sheer beauty of it.Architects and students alike will treasure this book for its wealth of practical information and its precise illustrations. Mr. Ching has once again created a visual reference that illuminates the world of architectural form.</p><p>Francis D.K. Ching, Registered Architect, is the principal of Ching Design Associates. He is also a professor of architecture at the University of Washington in Seattle.

The result of the historical conditions (of the age) was an art which, like much modern art, was heterogenous, often cosmopolitan, increasingly individualistic, and frequently elite in its appeal&#39;. This 1986 book is an interpretative history of Greek art during the Hellenistic period - i.e. from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, to the establishment of the Roman Empire at the end of the first century BC - which also explores ways in which that art is an expression of the cultural experience and aspirations of the Hellenistic age.</p><p>This interpretative work on Greek art during the Hellenistic period (323 B.C. to the first century B.C.) explores ways in which art is an expression of the cultural experience and aspirations of an age. It also strives to present a selective history of the formal development of Hellenistic art.&#34;...excellent overview of the art and temperament of the Hellenistic Age....The focus of this book is admirably wide-ranging....In the process of his skillful art historical analyses, Politt presents many astute and thought-provoking observations on and interpretations of the social history of this pivotal period in the development of western civilization.&#34; David W. Rupp, Classical Views</p><h2>Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Applying fresh tools from economics to explain puzzling behaviors of religious radicals: Muslim, Christian, and Jewish; violent and benign.</b></p><p>How do radical religious sects run such deadly terrorist organizations? Hezbollah, Hamas, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Taliban all began as religious groups dedicated to piety and charity. Yet once they turned to violence, they became horribly potent, executing campaigns of terrorism deadlier than those of their secular rivals. In <i>Radical, Religious, and Violent</i>, Eli Berman approaches the question using the economics of organizations. He first dispels some myths: radical religious terrorists are not generally motivated by the promise of rewards in the afterlife (including the infamous seventy-two virgins) or even by religious ideas in general. He argues that these terrorists (even suicide terrorists) are best understood as rational altruists seeking to help their own communities. Yet despite the vast pool of potential recruits&#x2015;young altruists who feel their communities are repressed or endangered&#x2015;there are less than a dozen highly lethal terrorist organizations in the world capable of sustained and coordinated violence that threatens governments and makes hundreds of millions of civilians hesitate before boarding an airplane. What's special about these organizations, and why are most of their followers religious radicals?</p><p>Drawing on parallel research on radical religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims, Berman shows that the most lethal terrorist groups have a common characteristic: their leaders have found a way to control defection. Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Taliban, for example, built loyalty and cohesion by means of mutual aid, weeding out &#x201c;free riders&#x201d; and producing a cadre of members they could rely on. The secret of their deadly effectiveness lies in their resilience and cohesion when incentives to defect are strong.These insights suggest that provision of basic social services by competent governments adds a critical, nonviolent component to counterterrorism strategies. It undermines the violent potential of radical religious organizations without disturbing free religious practice, being drawn into theological debates with Jihadists, or endangering civilians.</p></p><p>Eli Berman is Professor of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, and Research Director of International Security Studies at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation.<p>A brilliant study of terrorist violence, <i>Radical, Religious, and Violent</i> offers an innovative and powerful explanation for the lethality of violent religious groups.

He is rescued by the far-seeing Chinese merchant, and with him builds up a logging business in upper Burma. But haunted by his vision of the Royal Family, he journeys to the obscure town in India where they have been exiled. The picture of the tension between the Burmese, the Indian and the British, is excellent. Among the great range of characters are one of the court ladies, Miss Dolly, whom he marries: and the redoubtable Jonakin, part of the British-educated Indian colony, who with her husband has been put in charge of the Burmese exiled court. The story follows the fortunes - rubber estates in Malaya, businesses in Singapore, estates in Burma - which Rajkumar, with his Chinese, British and Burmese relations, friends and associates, builds up - from 1870 through the Second World War to the scattering of the extended family to New York and Thailand, London and Hong Kong in the post-war years.</p><p>Brilliant and impassioned, <b>The Glass Palace</b> is a masterly novel by Amitav Ghosh, the gifted novelist Peter Matthiessen has called an exceptional writer.

He asked illustrator David Fisher to combine four photos into the single painting, you see here. The geologist is enveloped by challenging structural relationships of folded rocks in outcrop; the curvature of back and neck, torqued as eyes and brain move closer and closer to clipboard, is the classic language of geologic mapping. When George Davis and new co-author Steve Reynolds contemplated the cover illustration for the second edition of Structural Geology of Rocks and Regions, they asked: &#34;Who else is in the picture?&#34; Stepping back, and handing David Fisher a couple of additional photos, the scene suddenly changed. The original geologist who had been sitting on the outcrop recording data is now up and walking around, gathering new data. A second geologist has moved into the new foreground, mapping and sketching a system of small-scale imbricate faults. Again, the head is torqued to handle the requirements of fine description and careful mapping. Like so many structural geologists, she seems to thrive on visualization of three-dimensional relationships.</p><p></p><h2>McDougal Littell Word Skills: Grade 6, Gold Level, The Language of Literature</h2><p>From Wikipedia: Verbal reasoning is understanding and reasoning using concepts framed in words.

Ben, Lucas, Parker, and Nadia wish to feel more comfortable in their bodies; three of them are also taking testosterone so that others recognize them as male. Following them over the course of a year, Stein shows how members of this young transgender generation, along with other gender dissidents, are refashioning their identities and challenging others&#x2019; conceptions of who they are. During a time of conservative resurgence, they do so despite great personal costs.&nbsp;<br><br>Transgender men comprise a large, growing proportion of the trans population, yet they remain largely invisible. In this powerful, timely, and eye-opening account, Stein draws from dozens of interviews with transgender people and their friends and families, as well as with activists and medical and psychological experts.&nbsp;<i>Unbound</i>&nbsp;documents the varied ways younger&nbsp;trans men see themselves and how they are changing our understanding of what it means to be male and female in America.</p><p><b>ARLENE STEIN</b> is a professor of sociology at Rutgers University and director of the Institute for Research on Women. The author of six books, she received the Ruth Benedict Prize for her book <i>The Stranger Next Door</i>. Stein has written for&nbsp;<i>The Nation, Jacobin, and The New Inquiry, </i>among other publications. She lives in New Jersey.In current parlance, I am &#x201c;cisgender,&#x201d; which means I do not identify as transgender. (The prefix &#x201c;trans&#x201d; is Latin for &#x201c;on the other side,&#x201d; and &#x201c;cis&#x201d; in Latin means &#x201c;on the same side.&#x201d;) That is, I experience my assigned sex and gender as congruent, at least to the degree that it has not become a major challenge in my life. When I was a kid growing up, I remember thinking that it would be cool to be a boy. Since I am now middle-aged, I can remember a time when girls were compelled to wear dresses to school, abortion was illegal, and team sports were something that boys, and not girls, could participate in. Boys got to play with electric trains, which I lusted after but my parents refused to give me&#x2014;they were &#x201c;boys&#x2019; toys.&#x201d; Men didn&#x2019;t have to go through the pain of childbirth, and they fronted the best rock-and-roll bands. Why wouldn&#x2019;t one dream of being a man?<br> &nbsp;<br> For me, identifying as a feminist and a lesbian enables me to express my femaleness in ways that seem true enough. But over the years I learned that there are others who feel that they were assigned a gender at birth that seems inauthentic and wrong&#x2014;so much so that many seek out body modifications to bring their bodies into alignment with their selves. A number of years ago, I noticed a young man working in my campus bookstore who seemed vaguely familiar to me. I stared at him for several moments out of the corner of my eye, racking my brain to figure out how I knew him, while trying my best not to attract his attention. Suddenly, I realized that he had once been a student of mine, and that I knew him as female, but now he had peach fuzz on his face, a deep voice, and was all but indistinguishable from the other young men who worked alongside him selling camera equipment. But I was so ill-equipped to figure out how to respond that I pretended not to recognize him, and he did the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then in February 2013, Kate, an artist friend of mine, accompanied a close friend of hers who was undergoing top surgery&#x2014;chest masculinization&#x2014;in Florida. &#x201c;You would not believe the numbers of people there,&#x201d; she told me, describing the long line of individuals, mainly in their twenties, who were waiting in the surgeon&#x2019;s office. South Florida was once known for a Spring Break scene that drew legions of college students eager for hot fun in the sun&#x2014;a scene immortalized by the 1960 comedy <i>Where the Boys Are</i>. Today it is also where the &#x201c;bois&#x201d;&#x2014;young, female-assigned people, who identify as masculine, some of whom undergo gender transitions&#x2014;go to masculinize their chests.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scene at the doctor&#x2019;s office surprised Kate. &#x201c;There were people from everywhere you could imagine, and many of them were very young,&#x201d; she told me in her soft Texas drawl. &#x201c;Some even brought their parents!&#x201d; In a nearby gated community, a guesthouse had been established to accommodate the steady flow of patients who needed a place to stay while they recovered from surgery. My curiosity was piqued when, a few months later, I happened to hear about another friend whose nephew also underwent &#x201c;top surgery&#x201d; in South Florida, and then I saw a mention of the same doctor in a magazine. Why were so many people flocking to Florida to modify their chests? What were they seeking? What did they find? More broadly, what does it mean that more and more female-assigned individuals are choosing to masculinize their bodies today? What might it tell us about how our notions of gender are changing more generally?<br> &nbsp;<br> Sociologists, or at least my breed of sociologist, try to get as close to a subject as they possibly can, immersing themselves in it. That&#x2019;s how I met Ben. I came across the crowdfunding website he had set up and I e-mailed him. He quickly agreed to let me tag along during his surgery week. So I booked my room and plane ticket and traveled down to Florida from my home in New Jersey to meet him&#x2014;and, as it turned out, his parents too.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Dr. Garramone&#x2019;s office, I also met the four others who were scheduled for surgery the same day as Ben. Three of them were good enough to agree to speak with me: Lucas DeMonte, a twenty-three-year-old health outreach worker from Gainesville, Florida; Parker Price, a twenty-four-year-old software sales manager from Austin, Texas; and Nadia Khoury, a twenty-eight-year-old employ�ment counselor from St. Louis, Missouri. Lucas, Parker, and Nadia, along with Ben, are the subjects of this book. They have allowed me to interview them and their friends and family, and over the next year, they permitted me to follow them at regular intervals, spoke with me over the phone and Skype, and even welcomed me into their homes on occasion. As I got to know them over the course of the next year, I came to better understand the lives and choices of a younger generation of gender dissidents.

Its core comprises discussion of the period performer&#39;s myriad primary source materials and their interpretation, the various aspects of style and general technique that combine to make up a well-grounded, period interpretation, and a survey of performance conditions and practices, focusing on the period c. 1700-c. 1900. Many of the principles outlined are illustrated in case studies of works by Bach, Mozart, Berlioz and Brahms.</p><p>&#34;This book presents a concise overview of the main topics of historical performance practice. It is rather remarkable how the authors, in little over 200 pages, address so many practical issues of historical performance practice and help the reader get a firm grip on the main ideas of some rather complex topics.

The experimental spirit that set Whistler's nocturnes ablaze also spurred Louis Tiffany's abstract patterning of colors and shapes in domestic interiors. Embroiderers who wielded their needles much as painters did their brushes created ambitious wall hangings and crazy quilts. In architecture, the search for a vernacular led to a colonial revival. Some designers turned to exotic influences, for example, landscape painter Frederic Church, whose summer home, Olana, juxtaposed Moorish, Romanesque and Buddhist elements. Heated debates raged about what constituted artful surface ornament in textiles, carpets and wallpaper. The esthetic movement was eclipsed by art nouveau and the arts-and-crafts movement, yet its influence can be felt down to Frank Lloyd Wright. This catalogue of an exhibition at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art reproduces hundreds of stunning works of art, from stained glass windows to paintings by Ryder, Homer and LaFarge. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This exhibition catalog's noble proportions celebrate its subject; the book combines scholarly analysis with ample visual satisfaction. The 11 essays by notable American scholars cover much ground: decorative arts (ornamentation, interior design, furniture, stained glass, ceramics, metalwork); painting; sculpture; and architecture. Opening and concluding essays offer challenging assessments of the Aesthetic movement's impact on American culture and literature.

This book traces the course of the river through four centuries, recounting the stories of explorers and traders, artists and writers, entrepreneurs and industrialists, ecologists and preservationists&#x2014;those who have been shaped by the river as well as those who have helped shape it. Their compelling narratives attest to the Hudson River&#x2019;s distinctive place in American history and the American imagination. Among those who have figured in the history of the Hudson are Benedict Arnold, Alexander Hamilton, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the Astors and the Vanderbilts, and Thomas Cole of the Hudson River school. Their stories appear here, alongside those of such less famous individuals as the surveyor who found the source of the Hudson and the engineer who tried to build a hydroelectric plant at Storm King Mountain. Inviting us to view the river from a wider perspective than ever before, this entertaining and enlightening book is worthy of its grand subject.</p><p><br> &nbsp;</p></p><p>"Few places in America can match the beauty, the majesty, and the historic significance of the Hudson River. Thanks to Tom Lewis's elegant style, penetrating observations, and marvelous illustrations, we at last have a book worthy of such a grand topic."&#x2014;Kenneth T. Jackson, Editor of The Encyclopedia of New YorkQ: In your book, you describe the Hudson as a river of firsts.&#x201d; What do you mean by that?<p></p>A: <i>The Hudson holds a unique place in American history. Our first explorers and settlers regarded it as the avenue into our continent&#x2019;s vast uncharted interior; in the Revolution, George Washington considered it the first line of defense. The Hudson Valley was the setting for America&#x2019;s first great writers and painters. Millions of immigrants encountered the Hudson when they first landed in America; the Hudson&#x2019;s deepwater port helped New York City become the nation&#x2019;s foremost financial center. And more recently, at Storm King Mountain the river became the first battleground of environmentalists. These are just a few of the firsts that I&#x2019;ve tried to bring to life in this history.<p></p></i>Q: Why has the Hudson River loomed so large in the American imagination?<p></p><i>A: Like all rivers, it has a utilitarian function for travel and commerce, but the Hudson has never been just a river. For four centuries the Hudson Valley has been a vast stage on which we have acted out our desires and dreams be they noble like Thomas Cole&#x2019;s landscapes of the Catskills or ignoble like Benedict Arnold&#x2019;s betrayal of the American cause at West Point. On the Hudson we have displayed all of our virtues and not a few of our vices.<p></p></i>Q: In the past, you&#x2019;ve written about the history of American radio and the national highway system.

His next play, Death of a Salesman, stunned audiences with its brilliance and was quickly became a classic of the modern theatre. It also sparked heated debates over the true nature of tragedy. Arthur Miller was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1949 for Death of a Salesman. He has come to be considered one of the greatest dramatists in the history of the American Theatre, and his plays continue to be produced worldwide.Arthur Miller's play is a bit melodramatic and uses some crude dramaturgy, but it's an entertaining period piece written in 1955 and set in Brooklyn during that era. Ed O'Neill (who played Al Bundy on "Married... With Children") is convincing as Eddie Carbone, the Italian-American longshoreman at the center of this play about obsession and betrayal. Jamie Hanes and Harry Hamlin put on passable accents as illegal Sicilian immigrants hiding out in the Carbone home. The play also benefits from judicious editing that makes the action easier to follow in an audio-only format.

NightNo Bio</p><h2>Comfortable with Uncertainty: 108 Teachings</h2><p>In this book Tibetan Buddhist nun Pema Ch�dr�n offers short, stand-alone readings designed to help us cultivate compassion and awareness amid the challenges of daily living. More than a collection of thoughts for the day, <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty </i> offers a progressive program of spiritual study. Inspired by the Buddhist tradition of the 108-day retreat, the book leads the reader through essential concepts, themes, and practices on the Buddhist path. <br><br> <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty </i> does not assume prior knowledge of Buddhist thought or practice, making it a perfect introduction to Ch�dr�n's teaching. It features the most essential and stirring passages from Ch�dr�n's previous books, exploring topics such as lovingkindness, meditation, mindfulness, "nowness," letting go, and working with fear and other painful emotions. Through the course of this book, readers will learn practical methods for heightening awareness and overcoming habitual patterns that block compassion. <i>Comfortable with Uncertainty, </i>like a set of prayer beads, strings together 108 gems that will guide and inspire us.</p><p><i>Comfortable with Uncertainty</i> reads like a perfect companion guide to the traditional 108-day Buddhist retreat. In a day-by-day format, author Pema Ch�dr�n dives into the soothing wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism, reminding us that groundlessness is the only ground we have to stand on. Each of her 108 teachings are brief (about two pages), and all of them are excerpted from longer discussions in Ch�dr�n's previous bestselling books (<i>The Places That Scare You</i> and <i>When Things Fall Apart</i>). Nonetheless, newcomers as well as seasoned fans of Ch�dr�n's writing will glean much from this training program for becoming a "warrior bodhisattva"--a term which, simply put, means one who aspires to act from an awakened heart.<p>Gradually, Ch�dr�n guides readers beyond the tunnel vision of the self, expanding outward to include compassion for all of humanity. In the 12th teaching, "The Root of Suffering," Ch�dr�n writes: "What keeps us unhappy and stuck in a limited view of reality is our tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain, to seek security and avoid groundlessness, to seek comfort and avoid discomfort." In the 77th teaching, "Cool Loneliness," she suggests that the next time readers wake up in the morning feeling the "heartache of alienation" they try to "relax and touch the limitless space of the human heart." By the 101st teaching, Ch�dr�n speaks to "taking refuge in the Sangha," meaning becoming warriors who are not only committed to taking off their own armors of self-pity, but are also committed to gently helping others do the same. Student warriors will also appreciate the glossary, bibliography, and resource guide in the back. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Chodron, a Buddhist nun, teaches the philosophy that she shares with studentsin her workshops, seminars, and meditation retreats around the world.3 CDs.</p><h2>The Consolations of Mortality: Making Sense of Death</h2><p><b>A penetrating and provocative exploration of human mortality, from Epicurus to Joan Didion</b><br><br> For those who don&#x2019;t believe in an afterlife, the wisdom of the ages offers four great consolations for mortality: that death is benign and good; that mortal life provides its own kind of immortality; that true immortality would be awful; and that we experience the kinds of losses in life that we will eventually face in death. Can any of these consolations honestly reconcile us to our inevitable demise?<br> &nbsp;<br> In this timely book, Andrew Stark tests the psychological truth of these consolations and searches our collective literary, philosophical, and cultural traditions for answers to the question of how we, in the twenty-first century, might accept our mortal condition. Ranging from Epicurus and Heidegger to bucket lists, the flaming out of rock stars, and the retiring of sports jerseys, Stark&#x2019;s poignant and learned exploration shows how these consolations, taken together, reveal death as a blessing no matter how much we may love life.</p><p><b>Andrew Stark </b>is professor of management and political science at the University of Toronto.

Yet, even before the Solutreans, the American continent was home to a powerful population of enormous stature, giants remembered in Native American legend as the Thunder People. New research shows they were hybrid descendants of an extinct human group known as the Denisovans, whose existence has now been confirmed from fossil remains found in a cave in the Altai region of Siberia. <br><br>Tracing the migrations of the Denisovans and their interbreeding with Neanderthals and early human populations in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the Americas, Andrew Collins and Greg Little explore how the new mental capabilities of the Denisovan-Neanderthal and Denisovan-human hybrids greatly accelerated the flowering of human civilization over 40,000 years ago. They show how the Denisovans displayed sophisticated advances, including precision-machined stone tools and jewelry, tailored clothing, celestially-aligned architecture, and horse domestication. Examining evidence from ancient America, the authors reveal how Denisovan hybrids became the elite of the Adena mound-building culture, explaining the giant skeletons found in Native American burial mounds. The authors also explore how the Denisovans&#x2019; descendants were the creators of a cosmological death journey and viewed the Milky Way as the Path of Souls. <br><br>Revealing the impact of the Denisovans upon every part of the world, the authors show that, without early man&#x2019;s hybridization with Denisovans, Neanderthals, and other yet-to-be-discovered hominid populations, the modern world as we know it would not exist.</p><p>Andrew Collins is a science and history writer, who has been investigating the origins of human civilization for over three decades.

The Denisovan Horizon</b> <br><br>A recent DNA study of the Inuit of Greenland showed that a gene that aids the population to survive the Arctic cold was inherited from an extinct human species known as the Denisovans, whose suspected home was central Eurasia, southern Siberia in particular. What this means is that at some point in the distinct past the Paleo-ancestors of the Inuit must have interbred with Denisovans, who had developed this all-important gene across tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years existing in frozen climates. <br><br>DNA evidence obtained from modern human populations around the world tells us that the Denisovans, or more specifically their hybrid descendants, were eventually dispersed into several widely different regions of the eastern Eurasian landmass. Denisovan DNA has been found in ethnic groups in central Asia, southern Siberia, Mongolia, China, Japan, Korea, India, the Tibetan plateau, as well as further east in Melanesia, Australia, and the Solomon Islands in the Southern Pacific. Indeed, it is among indigenous populations in Australia and Melanesia, Papua New Guinea especially, that by far the highest admixture of Denisovan DNA is found; this being anything up to 5 percent in some cases. It has also been found among several indigenous groups in North America, Central America, and South America. This tells us that either the Denisovans or their hybrid descendants must have entered the Americas before the final submergence of the Beringia land bridge linking Siberia with Alaska circa 8500 BCE. <br><br>In addition to this, it should be pointed out that to date the only known anatomical evidence supporting the former existence of an independent Denisovan population is the discovery of four human fossils found in a single cave in southern Siberia. These are a fingertip of a young girl and a large molar, both of which date to circa 50,000-40,000 years before the present, along with two other teeth that are tens of thousands of years older than the other fossils. All were found during excavations at the Denisova Cave, an archaeological site located in a rocky cliff face high above the Anui River in the Altai Mountains of Altai Krai in Russian Siberia, close to the border with Kazakhstan, China, and Mongolia. <br><br>The existence of these fossil remains tells us that the Denisovans must have occupied southern Siberia around 120,000-40,000 years before the present day, since this adequately reflects the date range of the archaeological layers in which these discoveries were made. Where exactly the Denisovans might have thrived before this time remains unclear. They could have existed in southern Siberia for many hundreds of thousands of years, or they could have turned up in the region only shortly before the age of the oldest remains found inside the Denisova Cave. What we do know, however, is that around 40,000 years ago the Denisovans ceased to exist as an independent hominin population, with only their hybrid descendants remaining to continue their legacy through till the present day. <br><br>These Denisovan descendants would have included not only Denisovan-human hybrids as modern DNA evidence makes clear, but also Denisovan-Neanderthal hybrids as well. We know this from genetic evidence taken from the toe bone of a young female Neanderthal found within Layer 11 of the Denisova Cave, which dates to circa 70,000-40,000 years before the present. DNA testing of the Neanderthal bone fragment revealed that the immediate ancestors of this female had interbred not only with Denisovans, but also with early modern humans. This occurred most likely in southwest Asia sometime prior to the proposed eastward migration of Neanderthal groups into southern Siberia around 55,000 years ago, or even earlier still. <br><br>Returning now to the Inuit population of Greenland, we must ask ourselves how they came to inherit not one, but two Denisovan genes. Known to geneticists as TBX15 and WARS2, they were first identified as Denisovan in origin when the population&#x2019;s genome was sequenced in 2010. What&#x2019;s important about these findings is that even though these genes were found to be common among the Inuit of Greenland (and presumably also those of Arctic Canada and Alaska) they are relatively rare among other human groups. Not only does this make it clear that the Inuit interbred with Denisovans, but also that this introgression must have occurred in a region formerly inhabited by this extinct population, or at least their direct descendants.<br><br><i><b>Inuit Homelands</b></i> <br><br>The Inuit inhabit a vast region spanning the extreme Arctic region of North America in what is today Canada, as well as in Greenland, where they are known as the Kalaaleq. The Inuit share a common ancestry with the Mongolian peoples of eastern and southern Siberia, the later having crossed the Bering Sea from Siberia into Alaska around the end of the last ice age. <br><br>Like the Mongolians, Inuit culture is rooted very strongly in shamanistic traditions involving a powerful belief in magic and the supernatural. In addition to this, the Eskimo-Aleut languages (as principally exemplified by central Alaskan Yupik) have been found to share a number of important typological traits in common with the Mongolic and Tungusic languages, along with others of a primarily Altaic origin.<br><br><i><b>Swan Ancestry</b></i> <br><br>What is more, the Inuit/Aleut/Yupik preserve their own versions of the swan maiden myth. This is used to explain the population&#x2019;s mythical ancestry from a swan mother, a tradition that almost certainly had its inception in North Asia during the Palaeolithic age. Even today a belief in swan ancestry remains strong among the Altaian peoples of southern Siberia, and also further to the east among the Buryat tribes of the Cis-baikal region west of Lake Baikal. A strong belief in swan ancestry is found also among the Mongolians of Central Mongolia, which is located to the south of Lake Baikal. <br><br>With these thoughts in mind it seems likely that the Paleo-Siberian ancestors of the Inuit came originally from North Asia, most obviously southern Siberia, which remains the only confirmed ancient homeland of the Denisovans.</p><h2>Mosby&#39;s Drug Guide for Nursing Students</h2><p><p>From the most-trusted name in nursing comes the drug handbook designed especially for students. <b>Mosby's Drug Guide for Nursing Students, 13th Edition</b> provides you with the latest information on more than 4,000 generic and trade name drugs - including 42 new FDA-approved drugs.

Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.<p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p><p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p><p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

Now, for the first time, <i>The Bon App?tit Cookbook</i> brings together more than 1,200 of the magazine?s all-time best-loved recipes for every meal and occasion. The book is accessible and user-friendly -- just like the magazine -- and includes clear explanations and exclusive tips from the Bon App?tit test kitchen, along with 59 detailed illustrations of ingredients and techniques.</p><p>The recipes have been skillfully selected to represent the very best of the magazine?s sophisticated, foolproof style: easy-to-make dishes that incorporate a variety of regional and international influences -- recipes that are delicious the first time out. From Cajun-Grilled Shrimp to Artichoke and Mushroom Lasagna to Hot and Sticky Apricot-Glazed Chicken to Molasses Chewies with Brown Sugar Glaze, there are dishes that will tempt every palate. Complete with a gorgeous 32-page color insert and a simple yet elegant design throughout, <i>The Bon App?tit Cookbook</i> is a must for those who truly love to make and enjoy great food.</p></p><p>It's high time that <i>Bon App�tit</i>, one of our longest-running cooking magazines, published a collection of its recipes. <i>The Bon App�tit Cookbook</i> offers over 1,200 formulas--a vast selection that includes dishes for every menu stop and occasion, with sections on bread, burgers, pizza and sandwiches. Characteristically, the majority of the formulas--like Chinese-Flavored Fried Chicken with Green Onion Ginger Dipping Sauce, and Spicy Steak with Corn Soft Tacos--reflect an inventive, cross-cultural approach. A wide selection of sweets, such as Chocolate Chunk, Orange and Hazelnut Cookies, and Lemon Blueberry Shortcakes, is also offered; there's even a chapter on drinks. <p> Though most of the dishes invite good eating, and all are approachable, a surprising number, like Blue and Red Flannel Hash (with potatoes, hot sausage, pickled beets, and blue cheese) are overwrought or of questionable taste. Herbs are sometimes used excessively (a seafood-cake recipe for six calls for 1-1/3 cups of chopped cilantro), or in dubious combination, like rosemary and tarragon. Readers should also know that ingredients are sometimes not named in the methods, but are called for by number--for example, "add the first five ingredients"--obliging cooks to stop, search and count. In addition, recipe yields in a given chapter can vary by four servings or more. Though some of the larger-yield recipes, like that for cassoulet, are obviously meant for groups, others, like Greek Orzo and Shrimp Salad, which yields twenty servings, could be offered as appropriately for a family meal. </p><p> These things said, the book, which is photo-illustrated, will make a welcome addition to many cooking libraries, and should be especially handy when guests must be fed.

Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in <i>Out of the Crisis</i>.</b></p><p><i>"... competition, we see now, is destructive. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management."</i></p><p>In this book W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The system of profound knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows how a style based on cooperation rather than competition can help people develop joy in work and learning at the same time that it brings about long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job and grades in school.</p><p>Previously published by MIT-CAES</p></p><p>W. Edwards Deming (1900&#x2013;1993) was international consultant in management and quality. In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Ronald Reagan.We started our Deming journey when I attended Dr. Deming's seminars and then began meeting privately with him decades ago.&nbsp; His book, The New Economics, with this new chapter, applies Deming's brilliance to everyday leadership challenges &#x2013;as well as to strategic ones.

Indeed, it can be argued that an inarticulate, half-conscious Platonism is nearly universal among mathematicians. The basic idea is that mathematical entities exist outside space and time, outside thought and matter, in an abstract realm. In the more eloquent words of Edward Everett, a distinguished nineteenth-century American scholar, "in pure mathematics we contemplate absolute truths which existed in the divine mind before the morning stars sang together, and which will continue to exist there when the last of their radiant host shall have fallen from heaven." In <em>What is Mathematics, Really?</em>, renowned mathematician Rueben Hersh takes these eloquent words and this pervasive philosophy to task, in a subversive attack on traditional philosophies of mathematics, most notably, Platonism and formalism.<br> Virtually all philosophers of mathematics treat it as isolated, timeless, ahistorical, inhuman. Hersh argues the contrary, that mathematics must be understood as a human activity, a social phenomenon, part of human culture, historically evolved, and intelligible only in a social context. Mathematical objects are created by humans, not arbitrarily, but from activity with existing mathematical objects, and from the needs of science and daily life. Hersh pulls the screen back to reveal mathematics as seen by professionals, debunking many mathematical myths, and demonstrating how the "humanist" idea of the nature of mathematics more closely resembles how mathematicians actually work. At the heart of the book is a fascinating historical account of the mainstream of philosophy--ranging from Pythagoras, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant, to Bertrand Russell, David Hilbert, Rudolph Carnap, and Willard V.O. Quine--followed by the mavericks who saw mathematics as a human artifact, including Aristotle, Locke, Hume, Mill, Peirce, Dewey, and Lakatos. In his epilogue, Hersh reveals that this is no mere armchair debate, of little consequence to the outside world. He contends that Platonism and elitism fit well together, that Platonism in fact is used to justify the claim that "some people just can't learn math." The humanist philosophy, on the other hand, links mathematics with geople, with society, and with history. It fits with liberal anti-elitism and its historical striving for universal literacy, universal higher education, and universal access to knowledge and culture. Thus Hersh's argument has educational and political ramifications.<br> Written by the co-author of <em>The Mathematical Experience</em>, which won the American Book Award in 1983, this volume reflects an insider's view of mathematical life, based on twenty years of doing research on advanced mathematical problems, thirty-five years of teaching graduates and undergraduates, and many long hours of listening, talking to, and reading philosophers. A clearly written and highly iconoclastic book, it is sure to be hotly debated by anyone with a passionate interest in mathematics or the philosophy of science.</p><p>In <i>What Is Mathematics, Really?</i>, author Reuben Hersh proposes a philosophy of mathematics that he calls "humanism" and uses this philosophy to analyze age-old questions of proof, certainty, and invention versus discovery. He also surveys the history of the philosophy of math. Readers of all levels of mathematical experience will be stimulated by the fascinating and perspicacious discussions Hersh has to offer.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Reuben Hersh</strong> taught at several distinguished colleges and universities around the country.

The material is reinforced with numerous examples to illustrate principles and imaginative, well-illustrated problems of varying degrees of difficulty. The book is committed to developing users&#39; problem-solving skills. Features new &#34;Photorealistc&#34; figures (approximately 400) that have been rendered in often 3D photo quality detail to appeal to visual learners. Presents a thorough combination of both static and dynamic engineering mechanics theory and applications. Features a large variety of problem types from a broad range of engineering disciplines, stressing practical, realistic situations encountered in professional practice, varying levels of difficulty, and problems that involve solution by computer. For professionals in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, aeronautical engineering, and engineering mechanics careers.</p><p><p> The main purpose of this book is to provide the student with a clear and thorough presentation of the theory and applications of engineering mechanics. To achieve this objective, the author has by no means worked alone; to a large extent, this book, through its 10 editions, has been shaped by the comments and suggestions of hundreds of reviewers in the teaching profession as well as many of the author's students. </p> <p><b>New Features</b></p> <p> Some unique features used throughout this tenth edition include the following: </p> <ul> <li> <b>Illustrations.</b> Throughout the book, new photorealistic illustrations have been added that provide a strong connection to the 3-D nature of engineering. In addition, particular attention has been placed on providing a view of any physical object, its dimensions, and the vectors applied to it in a manner that can be easily understood.</li> <li> <b>Problems.</b> The problems sets have been revised so that instructors can select both design and analysis problems having a wide range of difficulty. Apart from the author, two other professionals have checked all the problems for clarity and accuracy of the solutions. At the end of some chapters, design projects are included.</li> <li> <b>Review Material.</b> New end-of-chapter review sections have been added to help students recall and study key chapter points.</li> </ul> <p> Of course, the hallmarks of the book remain the same: Where necessary, a strong emphasis is placed on drawing a free-body diagram, and the importance of selecting an appropriate coordinate system, and associated sign convention for vector components is stressed when the equations of mechanics are applied. </p> <p><b>Contents</b></p> <p><b>Statics</b></p> <p> The subject of Statics is covered in the first 11 chapters, in which the principles are applied first to simple, then to more complicated situations. Most often, each principle is applied first to a particle, then to a rigid body subjected to a coplanar system of forces, and finally to a general case of three-dimensional force systems acting on a rigid body. </p> <p> Chapter 1 begins with an introduction to mechanics and a discussion of units. The notation of a vector and the properties of a concurrent force system are introduced in Chapter 2. This theory is then applied to the equilibrium of a particle in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains a general discussion of both concentrated and distributed force systems and the methods used to simplify them. The principles of rigid-body equilibrium are developed in Chapter 5 and then applied to specific problems involving the equilibrium of trusses, frames, and machines in Chapter 6, and to the analysis of internal forces in beams and cables in Chapter 7. Applications to problems involving frictional forces are discussed in Chapter 8, and topics related to the center of gravity and centroid are treated in Chapter 9. If time permits, sections concerning more advanced topics, indicated by stars (*) may be covered. Most of these topics are included in Chapter 10 (area and mass moments of inertia) and Chapter 11 (virtual work and potential energy). Note that this material also provides a suitable reference for basic principles when it is discussed in more advanced courses. </p> <p> <b>Alternative Coverage.</b> At the discretion of the instructor, some of the Material may be presented in a different sequence with no loss of continuity. For example, it is possible to introduce the concept of a force and all the necessary methods of vector analysis by first covering Chapter 2 and Section 4.2. Then after covering the rest of Chapter 4 (force and moment systems), the equilibrium methods of Chapters 3 and 5 can be discussed. </p> <p><b>Dynamics</b></p> <p> The subject of Dynamics is presented in the last 11 chapters, the kinematics of a particle is discussed in Chapter 12, followed by a discussion of particle kinetics in Chapter 13 (equation of motion), Chapter 14 (work and energy), and Chapter 15 (impulse and momentum). The concepts of particle dynamics contained in these four chapters are then summarized in a "review" section, and the student is given the chance to identify and solve a variety of problems. A similar sequence of presentation is given for the planar motion of a rigid body: Chapter 16 (planar kinematics), Chapter 17 (equations of motion), Chapter 18 (work and energy), and Chapter 19 (impulse and momentum), followed by a summary and review set of problems for these chapters. </p> <p> If time permits, some of the material involving three-dimensional regid-body motion may be included in the course. The kinematics and kinetics of this motion are discussed in Chapters 20 and 21, respectively. Chapter 22 (vibrations) may be included if the student has the necessary mathematical background. Sections of the book which are considered to be beyond the scope of the basic dynamics course are indicated by a star (*) and may be omitted. Note that this material also provides a suitable reference for basic principles when it is discussed in more advanced courses. </p> <p> <b>Alternative Coverage.</b> At the discretion of the instructor, it is possible to cover Chapter 12 through 19 in the following order with no loss in continuity: Chapters 12 and 16 (kinematics), Chapters 13 and 17 (equations of motion), Chapters 14 and 18 (work and energy), and Chapters 15 and 19 (impulse and momentum). </p> <p><b>Special Features</b></p> <p> <b>Organization and Approach.</b> The contents of each chapter are organized into well-defined sections that contain an explanation of specific topics, illustrative example problems, and a set of homework problems. The topics within each section are placed into subgroups defined by boldface titles. The purpose of this is to present a structured method for introducing each new definition or concept and to make the book convenient for later reference and review. </p> <p> <b>Chapter Contents.</b> Each chapter begins with an illustration demonstrating a broad-range application of the material within the chapter. A bulleted list of the chapter contents is provided to give a general overview of the material that will be covered. </p> <p> <b>Free-Body Diagrams.</b> The first step to solving most mechanics problems requires drawing a diagram. By doing so, the student forms the habit of tabulating the necessary data while focusing on the physical aspects of the problem and its associated geometry. If this step is performed correctly, applying the relevant equations of mechanics becomes somewhat methodical since the data can be taken directly from the diagram. This step is particularly important when solving equilibrium problems, and for this reason drawing free-body diagrams is strongly emphasized throughout the book. In particular, special sections and examples are devoted to show how to draw free-body diagrams, and specific homework problems in many sections of the book have been added to develop this practice. </p> <p> <b>Procedures for Analysis.</b> Found after many of the sections of the book, this unique feature provides the student with a logical and orderly method to follow when applying the theory. The example problems are solved using this outlined method in order to clarify its numerical application. It is to be understood, however, that once the relevant principles have been mastered and enough confidence and judgment have been ed, the student can then develop his or her own procedures for solving problems. </p> <p> <b>Photographs.</b> Many photographs are used throughout the book to explain how the principles of mechanics apply to real-world situations. In some sections, photographs have been used to show how engineers must first make an idealized model for analysis and then proceed to draw a free-body diagram of this model in order to apply the theory. </p> <p> <b>Important Points.</b> This feature provides a review or summary of the most important concepts in a section and highlights the most significant points that should be realized when applying the theory to solve problems. </p> <p> <b>Conceptual Understanding.</b> Through the use of photographs placed throughout the book, theory is applied in a simplified way in order to illustrate some of its more important conceptual features and instill the physical meaning of many of the terms used in the equations. These simplified applications increase interest in the subject matter and better prepare the student to understand the examples and solve problems. </p> <p> <b>Example Problems.</b> All the example problems are presented in a concise manner and in a style that is easy to understand. </p> <p> <b>Homework Problems</b> </p> <ul> <li> <b>Free-Body Diagram Problems.</b> Many sections of the book contain introductory problems that only require drawing the free-body diagram for the specific problems within a problem set. These assignments will impress upon the student the importance of mastering this skill as a requirement for a complete solution of any equilibrium problem.</li> <li> <b>General Analysis and Design Problems.</b> The majority of problems in the book depict realistic situations encountered in engineering practice. Some of these problems come from actual products used in industry and are stated as such. It is hoped that this realism will both stimulate the student's interest in engineering mechanics and provide a means for developing the skill to reduce any such problem from its physical description to a model or symbolic representation to which the principles of mechanics may be applied. Throughout the book, there is an approximate balance of problems using either SI or FPS units Furthermore, in any set, an attempt has been made to arrange the problems in order of increasing difficulty. (Review problems at the end of each chapter are presented in random order.) The answers to all but every fourth problem are listed in the back of the book. To alert the user to a problem without a reported answer, an asterisk (*) is placed before the problem number.</li> <li> <b>Computer Problems.</b> An effort has been made to include some problems that may be solved using a numerical procedure executed on either a desktop computer or a programmable pocket calculator. Suitable numerical techniques along with associated computer programs are given in Appendix B. The intent here is to broaden the student's capacity for using other forms of mathematical analysis without sacrificing the time needed to focus on the application of the principles of mechanics. Problems of this type, which either can or must be solved using numerical procedures, are identified by a "square" symbol preceding the problem number.</li> <li> <b>Design Projects.</b> At the end of some of the chapters, design projects have been included. It is felt that this type of assignment should be given only after the student has developed a basic understanding of the subject matter. These projects focus on solving a problem by specifying the geometry of a structure or mechanical object needed for a specific purpose. A force analysis is required and, in many cases, safety and cost issues must be addressed</li> <li> <b>Chapter Reviews.</b> New chapter review sections summarize key point of the chapter, often in bulleted lists.</li> <li> <b>Appendices.</b> The appendices provide a source of mathematical formula and numerical analysis needed to solve the problems in the book. Appendix C provides a set of problems typically found on the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination. By providing a partial solution to all the problems, the student is given a chance to further practice his or her skills.</li> </ul></p><h2>Shakespeare and the Jews</h2><p>Going against the grain of the dominant scholarship on the period, which generally ignores the impact of Jewish questions in early modern England, James Shapiro presents how Elizabethans imagined Jews to be utterly different from themselves&#x2013;&#x2013;in religion, race, nationality, and even sexuality. From strange cases of Christians masquerading as Jews to bizarre proposals to settle foreign Jews in Ireland, this book looks into the crisis of cultural identity in Elizabethan England and sheds new light on <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i></p><p><i>The Merchant of Venice</i> has long been a problem play for lovers of Shakespeare. How could the greatest playwright in English, renowned for his depth of humanity, create a crude anti-Semitic stereotype like Shylock? The problem has been approached in diverse ways, from branding Shakespeare as an anti-Semite to interpreting his play as a nuanced depiction of Elizabethan anti-Semitism. James Shapiro, a professor of English at Columbia University, sets the problem within a wider field by examining the historical, social, and cultural status of the Jews in Shakespeare's England. He reveals that the Elizabethan view of the Jews was loaded with a complex symbolism that resonates throughout this play.Going against the grain of the dominant scholarship on the period, which generally ignores the impact of Jewish questions in early modern England, Shapiro presents how Elizabethans imagined Jews to be utterly different from themselves--in religion, race, nationality, and even sexuality.</p><h2>Learning Microsoft Publisher 2013, Student Edition -- CTE/School</h2><p><i>Learning Microsoft Publisher 2013</i> features a student-friendly, step-by-step format with clear, full-screen shots to engage readers and help them work independently.

But in this pathbreaking work, Charles King investigates the myriad of connections that have made the Black Sea more of a bridge than a boundary, linking religious communities, linguistic groups, empires, and later, nations and states.<br> <br> For some parts of the world, the idea of waterways as defining elements in human history is uncontroversial. Mention the Mediterranean or the South Pacific, and images of mutual influence come to mind. Those images come less readily for the Black Sea--a region that has experienced ethnic conflict, economic collapse, and interstate rivalries over the last two decades. But in the recent past, the idea of the Black Sea as a distinct unit was self-evident. From its formation some seven or eight millennia ago to the political revolutions and environmental crisis of the late twentieth century, the sea has been a zone of interaction - sometimes cordial, sometimes conflictual--among the peoples and states around its shores.<br> <br> To the ancient Greeks, the sea lay literally at the edge of the known world. In time, the growth of Greek trading colonies linked all the coasts into a web of economic relationships. In the Middle Ages, the sea was tied to the great commercial cities of Venice and Genoa. Later, the Ottomans used the region's resources to build their own empire. In the late eighteenth century, the sea was opened to foreign commerce, and the seacoasts were part of a genuinely global system of trade. After the collapse of the Russian and Ottoman empires, the coastline was carved up among a number of newly formed nation-states, with each asserting a right to a piece of the coast and a section of the coastal waters. <br> <br> Today, efforts to resurrect the idea of the Black Sea as a unified region are once again on the international agenda. Based on extensive research in multiple languages, this book is an indispensable guide to the history, cultures, and politics of this fascinating sea and its future at the heart of Europe and Eurasia.<br></p><p>Charles King is Ion Ratiu Professor of Romanian Studies and Assistant Professor of Government, Georgetown University.<br>"Like its subject, this book is a hybrid, a mostly engaging historical narrative drawn from an array of secondary sources.... a vivid account of the Black Sea's sometimes fascinating structural characteristics....

This sequel to Twain&#39;s &#34;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,&#34; is a first person narrative told by its title character. The novel picks up where &#34;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&#34; leaves off. Huck Finn who is now wealthy with the discovery of treasure at the end of &#34;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&#34; finds himself in great danger from his abusive drunkard father who wishes to cash in on Huck&#39;s fortune. Fearing for his life Huck believes that he must run away from his home with the Widow Douglas and her Sister, Miss Watson. Huck fakes his own death and escapes to Jackson&#39;s Island. There he finds Miss Watson&#39;s escaped slave, Jim. Together they escape down the Mississippi River on a raft. &#34;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&#34; is a story told in the time of slavery with language that embodies the regional dialects that are common to Twain&#39;s work and the Mississippi River Valley in which Twain grew up. The novel is as much a biting and satirical commentary on slavery, religion, and civilized society as it is a light-hearted comedy and buddy travel story through Midwestern 19th century America.

Indeed,&nbsp;<i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i>&nbsp;derives much of its depth and power from passions whose forbidden and overwhelming nature cannot be expressed by human beings and are therefore embodied in the natural world. In his depiction of the relationship between Lassiter, the hero, and Jane Withersteen, Grey breaks other literary barriers: Jane, modelled on the heroines of the nineteenth-century novel, must come to terms with the values expressed by Lassiter - the harsh, "masculine" values of the twentieth century. Their struggles together represent the tumultuous changes society itself was confronting.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

It is the story of Lassiter, a gunslinging avenger in black, who shows up in a remote Utah town just in time to save the young and beautiful rancher Jane Withersteen from having to marry a Mormon elder against her will. Lassiter is on his own quest, one that ends when he discovers a secret grave on Jane&#39;s grounds. &#34;[Zane Grey&#39;s] popularity was neither accidental nor undeserved,&#34; wrote Nye. &#34;Few popular novelists have possessed such a grasp of what the public wanted and few have developed Grey&#39;s skill at supplying it.&#34;</p><h2>Healing Earth: An Ecologist&#39;s Journey of Innovation and Environmental Stewardship</h2><p><b>A true pioneer and respected elder in ecological recovery and sustainability shares effective solutions he has designed and implemented.</b><br><br>A stand-out from the sea of despairing messages about climate change, well-known sustainability elder John Todd, who has taught, mentored, and inspired such well-known names in the field as Janine Benyus, Bill McKibben, and Paul Hawken, chronicles the different ecological interventions he has created over the course of his career. Each chapter offers a workable engineering solution to an existing environmental problem: healing the aftermath of mountain-top removal and valley-fill coal mining in Appalachia, using windmills and injections of bacteria to restore the health of a polluted New England pond, working with community members in a South African village to protect an important river. A mix of both success stories and concrete suggestions for solutions to tackle as yet unresolved issues, Todd's narrative provides an important addition to the conversation about specific ways we can address the planetary crisis. Eighty-five color photos and images illustrate Todd's concepts. This is a refreshingly hopeful, proactive book and also a personal story that covers a known practitioner's groundbreaking career.</p><p>A pioneer in ecological design, John Todd has been active in shaping the discipline for more than years. He has befriended and inspired such well-known figures in the field as Janine Benyus, Bill McKibben, Paul Hawken, David Orr, and Wes Jackson. Together with his wife, Nancy Jack Todd, Todd was named as a visionary of the twentieth century by the British organization Resurgence, and he has been featured in &#x201c;The Genius Issue&#x201d; of Esquire magazine. Dr. Todd was also named one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s top thirty-five inventors by the Lemelson-MIT Program for Invention and Innovation. In 2010 the Smithsonian Institution recognized his eco-machine at the Center for Sustainable Living, part of the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, as a significant design breakthrough.

But sometimes the best way to move forward is to look back. Philip Barlag shows us that Julius Caesar is one of the most compelling leaders of the past to study&#x2014;a man whose approach was surprisingly modern and extraordinarily effective. <br><br> History is littered with leaders hopelessly out of touch with their people and ruthlessly pursuing their own ambitions or hedonistic whims. But Caesar, who rose from impoverished beginnings, proved by his words and deeds that he never saw himself as being above the average Roman citizen. And he had an amazing ability to generate loyalty, to turn enemies into allies and allies into devoted followers. <br><br> Barlag uses dramatic and colorful incidents from Caesar&#x2019;s career&#x2014;being held hostage by pirates, charging headlong alone into enemy lines, pardoning people he knew wanted him dead&#x2014;to illustrate what Caesar can teach leaders today. Central to Barlag&#x2019;s argument is the distinction between force and power. Caesar avoided using brute force on his followers, understanding that fear never generates genuine loyalty. He exercised a power deeply rooted in his demonstrated personal integrity and his intuitive understanding of people&#x2019;s deepest needs and motivations. His supporters followed him because they <i>wanted</i> to, not because they were compelled to. Over 2,000 years after Caesar&#x2019;s death, this is still the kind of loyalty every leader wants to inspire. Barlag shows how anyone can learn to lead like Caesar.</p><p>Eternally fascinating, Julius Caesar was a leader ahead of his time whose grassroots, front lines leadership still has much to teach us 2000 years after his death.Phillip Barlag is an executive director at World 50, which initiates and facilitates the most interesting and influential business conversations in the world. He has the enormous privilege of serving remarkable leaders from some of the most well-respected companies around the globe. His work explores the authentic nature of success and struggle in leadership. His writing has been published in Fast Company, MIT Sloan Management Review, and a number of influential business blogs.

It contains a wealth of problems and exercises to guide the reader. It is also the first single-volume textbook to cover related fields of functional analysis and PDEs.</p></p><p>Uniquely, this book presents a coherent, concise and unified way of combining elements from two distinct &#x201c;worlds,&#x201d; functional analysis (FA) and partial differential equations (PDEs), and is intended for students who have a good background in real analysis. This text presents a smooth transition from FA to PDEs by analyzing in great detail the simple case of one-dimensional PDEs (i.e., ODEs), a more manageable approach for the beginner. Although there are many books on functional analysis and many on PDEs, this is the first to cover both of these closely connected topics. Moreover, the wealth of exercises and additional material presented, leads the reader to the frontier of research. This book has its roots in a celebrated course taught by the author for many years and is a completely revised, updated, and expanded English edition of the important &#x201c;Analyse Fonctionnelle&#x201d; (1983). Since the French book was first published, it has been translated into Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Romanian, Greek and Chinese. The English version is a welcome addition to this list. The first part of the text deals with abstract results in FA and operator theory. The second part is concerned with the study of spaces of functions (of one or more real variables) having specific differentiability properties, e.g., the celebrated Sobolev spaces, which lie at the heart of the modern theory of PDEs. The Sobolev spaces occur in a wide range of questions, both in pure and applied mathematics, appearing in linear and nonlinear PDEs which arise, for example, in differential geometry, harmonic analysis, engineering, mechanics, physics etc. and belong in the toolbox of any graduate student studying analysis.<p>From the reviews:</p><p>&#x201c;Brezis has intelligently chosen several fundamental concepts of functional analysis, and has build the book around them and their applications. ... for a newcomer who intends to become a user of functional analysis this book is an ideal place to start.

They discuss the apostle Peter and Roman Emperor Constantine, describe the role of Charlemagne in the expansion of the religion, and assess medieval scholasticism and the influence of Thomas Aquinas. The profound changes that occurred during both the Reformation and the Enlightenment are fully treated in chapters that offer revealing portraits of such key figures as Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and Rousseau. Fully one third of the book covers Christianity since 1800--with special studies of the faith as practiced in Britain and Europe, North and South America, Africa, India, and the Far East--offering a compelling continuous narrative filled with insight into the enormously diverse Christian world. In the final chapters, the authors consider questions of contemporary Christian theology, conscience and belief, and explore new concepts of Christian community.<br> Over 350 beautiful illustrations--including 32 full color plates--grace the text, ranging from mosaics, paintings and sculptures, to architecture and modern art. There are also ten maps, a chronology of important events, and an annotated guide to further reading.<br> Throughout, the book reflects the changing world in which Christians have found themselves, and the many ways in which, individually and through the institutions of the church, they in turn have influenced history.

Alley and his colleagues made headlines with the discovery that the last ice age came to an abrupt end over a period of only three years. In <i>The Two-Mile Time Machine</i>, Alley tells the fascinating history of global climate changes as revealed by reading the annual rings of ice from cores drilled in Greenland. He explains that humans have experienced an unusually temperate climate compared to the wild fluctuations that characterized most of prehistory. He warns that our comfortable environment could come to an end in a matter of years and tells us what we need to know in order to understand and perhaps overcome climate changes in the future.</p><p>In a new preface, the author weighs in on whether our understanding of global climate change has altered in the years since the book was first published, what the latest research tells us, and what he is working on next.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Two-Mile Time Machine</i> takes a story that has been much discussed in the press and revitalizes it with the author's infectious enthusiasm and with background information on the history of ice core drilling.

The Sophists assesses the contribution of individuals like Protagoras, Gorgias and Hippias to the extraordinary intellectual and moral fermant in fifth-century Athens. They questioned the bases of morality, religion and organized society itself and the nature of knowledge and language; they initiated a whole series of important and continuing debates, and they provoked Socrates and Plato to a major restatement and defence of traditional values.</p><p>fm.author_biographical_note1'This book, like the age it reflects, is a brilliant achievement.

Is Othello merely gullible or is there something about his place in society that makes him vulnerable? Why can there be no happy ending to <i>King Lear</i>? In this radical approach to Shakespearean tragedy, Fintan O'Toole, Ireland's foremost theater critic, shows how Shakespeare's plays have been made unintelligible to modern students. O'Toole explains that the plays have been filtered through a series of ideas that have less to do with what Shakespeare actually wrote than with Victorian interpretations of the plots and characters. O'Toole challenges the traditional approach to the study of four key tragedies&#x2014;<i>Hamlet, Othello, King Lear,</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>&#x2014;and provides an entertaining appreciation of the dramatic qualities of each. This is a provocative and accessible guide for students, teachers, and anyone interested in gaining a fresh insight into the world's greatest playwright.</p><p>Fintan O&#39;Toole was born in Dublin in 1958.

Jim McPherson, the affluent son of a defense contractor, is a young man lost in a world of fast cars, casual sex, and designer drugs. But his descent in to the shadowy underground of industrial terrorism brings him into a shattering confrontation with his family, his goals, and his ideals. The Gold Coast is the second novel in Robinson&#39;s Three Californias trilogy.</p><p><p><b>Kim Stanley Robinson</b>'s Three Californias trilogy -- <i>The Gold Coast</i>, <i>The Wild Shore</i> and <i>Pacific Edge -- </i>has been observed as "an intriguing work, one that will delight and entertain you, and, most importantly, cause you to stop and think" (<i>The Santa Ana Register</i>). His many other novels include <i>Escape from Kathmandu</i> and <i>Green Mars -- </i>which won the Hugo and Locus Award for Best Novel.</p><p>1<br>Beep beep!<br>Honk honk.<br>Jim McPherson sticks his head out the window of his car, shouts at a Minihonda whose program has just automatically slotted it onto the onramp ahead of him. &#x201c;You cut me off!&#x201d; The man in the Minihonda stares back at him, looking puzzled. Jim&#x2019;s ancient Volvo swerves sharply up the curving track and suddenly Jim&#x2019;s hanging halfway out the window and teetering, face inches from the concrete of the freeway. Abe Bernard grabs his belt and pulls him back in, whew!<br>Night in Orange County, here, and the four friends are cruising in autopia. Stars of their high school state championship wrestling team, ten years past that glory, they roll over the seats of the Volvo and try to pin Tashi Nakamura, to keep him away from the eye-dropper of Sandy Chapman&#x2019;s latest concoction. Tash was their heavyweight and the only one still in good shape, and they can&#x2019;t do it; Tash surges up through their arms and seizes the eyedropper, all the while singing along with one of Jim&#x2019;s old CDs: &#x201c;<em>Some</em>body give me a <em>cheese</em>burger!&#x201d; The onramp bends up, curves more sharply, the contacts squeak over the power-and-guidance electromagnetic track in the center of the lane, they&#x2019;re all thrown into a heap on the backseat. &#x201c;Uh-oh, I think I dropped the dropper.&#x201d; &#x201c;Say, we&#x2019;re on the freeway now, aren&#x2019;t we? Shouldn&#x2019;t someone be watching?&#x201d;<br>Instantly Abe squirms into the driver&#x2019;s seat. He has a look around. Everything&#x2019;s on track. Cars, following their programs north, hum over the eight brassy bands marking the center of each lane. River of red taillights ahead, white headlights behind, some cars rolling over the S-curved lane-change tracks, left to right, right to left, their yellow turnsignal indicators blinking the rhythm of the great plunge forward, click click click, click click click. All&#x2019;s well on the Newport Freeway tonight. &#x201c;Find that eyedropper?&#x201d; says Abe, a certain edge in his voice.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, here.&#x201d;<br>The northbound lanes swoop up as they cross the great sprawl of the intersection with the San Diego, Del Mar, Costa Mesa, and San Joaquin freeways. Twenty-four monster concrete ribbons pretzel together in a Gordian knot three hundred feet high and a mile in diameter--a monument to autopia--and they go right through the middle of it, like bugs through the heart of a giant. Then Jim&#x2019;s old buzzbox hums up a grade and suddenly it&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;re in a landing pattern for John Wayne International Airport over to their right, because the northbound Newport is on the highest of the stacked freeway levels, and they are a hundred feet above mother Earth. Nighttime OC, for miles in every direction.

A billion lights.<br>Ah yes: Orange County.<br>* * *<br>Jim blinks a big wash of Sandy&#x2019;s latest out of his eye, watches patterns pulse. All at once, in a satori illumination, he can see the pattern all the other patterns make: the layers of OC&#x2019;s lighting, decade on decade, generation on generation. In fact certain grids are lifting off and pivoting ninety degrees, to match the metapattern of the perceived whole. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d call this one Pattern Perception.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201c; Sandy says. &#x201c;I can see that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You could take aspirin and see that from up here,&#x201c; Abe objects.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true. I can see that too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ought to call it Agreeability,&#x201c; says Tashi.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true. I can see that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re at the center of the world,&#x201c; Jim announces. Abe and Tashi start looking around like they missed the marker--should be a plaque or something, right? &#x201c;Orange County is the end of history, its purest product. Civilization kept moving west for thousands of years, in a sunset tropism, until they came to the edge here on the Pacific and they couldn&#x2019;t go any farther. And so they stopped here and <em>did it</em>. And by that time they were in the great late surge of corporate capitalism, so that everything here is purely organized, to buy and sell, buy and sell, every little piece of us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fucking Marxist Commie.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They must have liked lights.&#x201d;<br>Jim shakes them off, waxes nostalgic. Mentioning history reminds him of the night&#x2019;s mission. &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t used to be this way!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding,&#x201c; says Tashi. He and Abe share grins: Jim can be funnier than the video.<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not kidding. This whole basin was covered with orange groves, over two hundred square miles of them. There were more oranges then than there are lights now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hard To Believe,&#x201c; his friends chorus together.<br>&#x201c;But true! OC was one big orchard.&#x201d; Jim sighs.<br>Abe and Tash and Sandy eye each other. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of trees,&#x201c; Abe says solemnly, and Tash stifles a laugh. Sandy doesn&#x2019;t bother; he goes into the famous Chapman laughing fit: &#x201c;<em>Ah</em>, hahahahahaha--<em>Ah</em>, hahahahahaha.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Say, don&#x2019;t you want to get off here?&#x201d; Tash asks.<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah!&#x201d; Jim cries.<br>Abe ticks over the lane-change switch and they swerve into the right lane, then spiral down the offramp two levels to Chapman Avenue, eastbound. Sandy&#x2019;s street. Only two levels here, and eastbound is the upper. In El Modena even that ends and they&#x2019;re back on ground level, in two-way traffic. &#x201c;What now, Professor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Park in the mall,&#x201c; Jim says.<br>Abe parks them. Jim consults his map for the last time. He is tense with excitement; this is a new idea, this mission, a sort of personal archaeology. Years of reading his local history books have given him an uncontrollable urge to recover something--to see, to touch, to <em>fondle</em>some relic of the past. And tonight&#x2019;s the night.<br>They are parked in front of the El Torito restaurant at the end of the Hewes Mall. &#x201c;This El Terriblo incorporates the oldest building in the area,&#x201c; Jim explains. &#x201c;It was a Quaker church, built in 1887. They put a big bell in the tower, but it was too heavy and during the next Santa Ana wind the whole building fell over. So they built it again. Anyway, you can&#x2019;t tell now, the restaurant is built over it and they use the old room as a casino. But it gives me a coordinate point, see, on the old maps. And exactly a hundred and forty yards west of here, on the other side of the street, is the site of El Modena Elementary School, built in 1905.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I missed that,&#x201c; says Tash.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone now. Razed in the 1960s. But my mom&#x2019;s great-uncle went there as a child, and he told me about it. And I looked it all up. There were two wooden buildings with a dirt yard in between. When they demolished the buildings they filled the cellars below with the debris, then covered it all in concrete. I&#x2019;ve got the location of those buildings pegged exactly, and the west one is directly under the Fluffy Donuts Video Palace and its parking lot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You mean,&#x201c; says Abe, &#x201c;we can just bust through the parking lot surface there--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s why I wanted you to bring some of your tools--&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bust through the concrete surface there, and dig through three or four feet of fill, and get down to the--get down to the <em>debris</em>of El Modena Elementary School, 1905 to 1960 A. D.?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, shoot,&#x201c; Abe says. &#x201c;What&#x2019;re we <em>waiting</em>for?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<em>Ahhh</em>, hahahahahahahaha...&#x201d;<br>Out of the car, grab up packs of equipment, walk down Chapman. Faces stare from passing cars at the sight of people walking. Jim is getting excited. &#x201c;There was a foundation stone, too, with the date carved on it. If we could find that...&#x201d;<br>At Fluffy&#x2019;s people dressed in the bright spectrum-bend primaries fashionable this year are downing incandescent green and purple and yellow donuts, then setting out into the holo reality of what appears to be African savanna. The four friends skirt the building and enter a small dark parking lot, bounded by Fluffy&#x2019;s, a supermarket wall on one side, a movie complex wall on the other, and an apartment complex wall at the back. The glow of OC, reflected off low clouds, gives them all the light they need. Jim points out the chalkmarks he made during his reconnaissance trip, there on oil-splotched old concrete just behind the wall of Fluffy&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Should be right under here.&#x201d;<br>Abe and Tash take off the backpacks and get out Abe&#x2019;s freeway rescue tools. Abe shakes his head at the sight of them. &#x201c;I really shouldn&#x2019;t have taken these, we always have spares but you never know...&#x201d; He picks up an oscilloscopic saw, Tash a needlejack, and they crack the surface and chop a hole fairly quickly. It&#x2019;s noisy work, but the ambient white noise of the city covers most of the sound. They put on work gloves and start pulling up broken blocks of concrete. The blocks are only about four inches t...</p></p><h2>Transformational Grammar: A First Course (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)</h2><p>Radford&#39;s new textbook is primarily for students with little or no background in syntax who need a lively and up-to-date introduction to contemporary work on transformational grammar. It covers four main topics: the goals of linguistic theory, syntactic structure, the nature and role of the lexicon, and the function and operations of transformations. The general framework considers major works, such as Chomsky&#39;s Knowledge of Language and Barriers , written since the publication of Radford&#39;s widely acclaimed Transformational Syntax in 1981. The present book uses a more recent theoretical construction and also covers a wider range of frameworks at the descriptive level than its predecessor. Radford is well known for his effective teaching approaches and this current volume demonstrates his talent by giving a concise, non-technical introduction to the field. At each chapter&#39;s end are exercises that reinforce the text, allowing students to apply the various concepts discussed and encouraging them to look more critically at some of the assumptions and analyses presented. Radford provides a useful, detailed bibliography of primary source material.</p><p>Intended primarily for students lacking background in syntax, this introduction covers the goals of linguistic theory, syntactic structure, the nature and role of the lexicon, and the function and operations of transformations.&#34;...it desrves full recognition for its clarity and excellent layout. ...this appears to be one of the pedagogically soundest introductions to transformational grammer on the market, and we can but recommend it.&#34; The Journal of Indo-European Studies</p><h2>Death Comes For The Archbishop (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>In 1851 Bishop Latour and his friend Father Valliant are despatched to New Mexico to reawaken its slumbering Catholicism.

In some cultures, diviners studied patterns in nature - the flight of birds, the forms of clouds, or the arrangement of the stars in the night sky. In others, they created elaborate divinatory systems such as the I Ching and the Tarot. Drawing from the legacy of 50,000 years of human encounters with the Divine, renowned Tarot scholar Rachel Pollack has created the <i>Shining Tribe Tarot</i>, a revised and expanded version of the popular <i>Shining Woman Tarot</i>. <br> <br>The <i>Shining Tribe Tarot</i> is steeped in symbolism drawn from culturally diverse systems including Neolithic rock art, Native American and African shamanism, Aboriginal art, the Kabbalah, Jungian psychology, and the traditional Tarot. The name <i>Shining Tribe</i> has a special meaning, says Ms. Pollack: "All of us who work with Tarot form a kind of tribe, one whose roots go back many thousands of years before the actual appearance of Tarot cards. This is the tribe of diviners, those special magicians, shamans, psychics, and visionaries who use cards, or sticks, or trees, or stones, or shells to communicate with the Gods." <br> <br>The accompanying book includes detailed descriptions of the origin and history of the symbols depicted on each card of this unique deck, as well as explanations of their meanings in divinatory spreads. In addition, you will also learn how to read the cards for a variety of purposes, including divination, advice, and guidance along your own personal sacred journey. Learn how to gain insights into the nightly messages from your subconscious mind with dream readings, and how to activate a card to bring its qualities into your everyday life. <br> <br>Rachel Pollack invites you to join the shining tribe of diviners and visionaries. As you continue along the sacred journey of self-discovery, let the <i>Shining Tribe Tarot</i> cards shine a path for you. <br> <br></p><p>For <i>The Shining Tribe Tarot</i>, a reprinted and slightly remodeled deck of tarot cards, Rachel Pollack changed the name from its original title <i>Shining Woman</i> to <i>Shining Tribe</i> because so many readers wrongly assumed that it was a deck designed for women. In fact, it is a deck for everyone, drawing heavily on nature-based, ancient symbols from around the world. Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles have been changed to Trees, Rivers, Birds, and Stones. Some of the cards contain Jewish Kabbalist symbols, such as the Four and Nine of Rivers, and others display images from Native American rock art (Five of Stones) or ancient Chinese art (Two of Birds). Although she departed from the familiar images, and her artwork is more primitive than refined, Pollack did follow the traditional Tarot structure with 78 cards in two parts: the Major Arcana (which she calls the "map of the soul's journey from birth to enlightenment") and the Minor Arcana (the "kaleidoscope of human experience in all its varied forms"). What makes this package stand out is Pollack's wise and poetic interpretations of each card (approximately two pages of discussion per card). In the Four of Birds, she explains, "We see a woman wearing a bird mask who has climbed a mountain to seek an encounter with Spirits. Despite her dedication, she must stop to rest." Many of us diligently work hard to attain self-knowledge or enlightenment, notes Pollack. Ironically, "the card promises truth and healing for those moments when we stop struggling." In the rear of the book, she outlines a variety of readings, such as three-card spreads that illuminate "Spiritual History, Spiritual Gift, and Spiritual Challenge." She also suggests novel ways to work with tarot cards that involve carrying specific cards with you or incorporating them into altars. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Rachel &nbsp;is considered one of the World&#x2019;s foremost authorities on the modern interpretation of the Tarot.

His urgent report covers a system of discrimination that extends to every nation. Women are deprived of equal opportunity in wealthier nations and &#x201c;owned&#x201d; by men in others, forced to suffer servitude, child marriage, and genital cutting. The most vulnerable, along with their children, are trapped in war and violence.<br> <br><i>A Call to Action</i> addresses the suffering inflicted upon women by a false interpretation of carefully selected religious texts and a growing tolerance of violence and warfare. Key verses are often omitted or quoted out of context by male religious leaders to exalt the status of men and exclude women. And in nations that accept or even glorify violence, this perceived inequality becomes the basis for abuse. President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, have visited 145 countries, and The Carter Center has had active projects in more than half of them. Around the world, they have seen inequality rising rapidly with each passing decade. This is true in both rich and poor countries, and among the citizens within them.<br> <br>Carter draws upon his own experiences and the testimony of courageous women from all regions and all major religions to demonstrate that women around the world, more than half of all human beings, are being denied equal rights. This is an informed and passionate charge about a devastating effect on economic prosperity and unconscionable human suffering. It affects us all.</p><p>Jimmy Carter was the thirty-ninth President of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981.

Following damage to the airway epithelium, a repair process of dedifferentiation, regenerative proliferation and redifferentiation takes place that is invariably accompanied by mucus hypersecretion as a key element in the host defence mechanism. In chronic respiratory diseases, however, excessive mucus production leads to a pathological state with increased risk of infection, hospitalization and morbidity. An understanding of the mechanisms that underlie and maintain this hypersecretory phenotype is therefore crucial for the development of rational approaches to therapy.<br> <br> Despite a high and increasing prevalence and cost to healthcare services and society, mucus hypersecretion in chronic respiratory disease has received little attention until recently, probably because of the difficulties inherent in studying this pathology. Only in the last few years have some of the genes involved in mucus secretion been characterized. The recent availability of genomic sequence information and specific antibodies has led to an explosion of interest in this area making this publication particularly timely.<br> <br> This book draws together contributions from an international and interdisciplinary group of experts, whose work is focused on both basic and clinical aspects of the problem. Coverage includes epidemiology, airways infection and mucus hypersecretion, the genetics and regulation of mucus production, models of mucus hypersecretion, and the implications of new knowledge for the development of novel therapies.</p><p><p><b>Derek J.

Assuming that you have a modest background in linear and matrix algebra, Laplace and z-transforms, and elementary differential equations, you&#39;ll find the presentation to be relatively self-contained. (Although a prior course in signals and systems would be helpful, it is not required.) The text develops continuous-time and discrete-time concepts and methodologies independently and in parallel. The frequent specialization to the time-invariant case allows the author to maximize clarity and accessibility of the theory while avoiding unenlightening technicalities. The text also presents material that is more often found in introductory control systems courses (e.g., controllability and observability, Lyapunov stability, and linear feedback and state observation). Of particular note are the chapters on geometric theory and applications, which give interpretation and insight into key systems&#39; theoretical ideas and results. The text also offers over 400 exercises of varying difficulty as an aid to the reader. Overall, this is an excellent text for graduate or advanced undergraduate students as well as a superb reference source.The basic theory of linear systems is developed in a unified, accessible, and careful manner, with parallel, independent treatment of continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems. Modest mathematical background is assumed, and the technical presentation is explicit and step-by-step. There are many examples to help the reader, and carefully chosen exercises.

And central to Caribbean literature is the short story, with its ties with the oral tradition. Now, <em>The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories</em>, edited by Stewart Brown and John Wickham, brings together fifty-two stories in a major anthology representing over a century's worth of pan-Caribbean short fiction. This breathtaking collection is unique--and indispensable--in its inclusion of authors from the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch-speaking Caribbean.<br><br>The distinctly Anglophone viewpoint of such prominent authors as, Jean Rhys, Sam Sevlon, V.S. Naipual, and E.A. Markham is richly contrasted by contributions from French, Spanish, and Dutch writers like Alejo Carpentier, Ren� Depestre, and Thea Doelwijt, while the new generation--represented by such writers as Edwidge Danticat and Patrick Chamoiseau--points the way forward for Caribbean writing into the twenty-first century. With his stimulating introduction, Brown provides an up-to-date overview of Caribbean writing. Exploring the literature's themes of history, race, social justice, identity, and migration, he traces its evolution from the gritty naturalism of the Anglophone tradition to the magical realism of the French and Spanish traditions to a body of contemporary pan-Caribbean literature that cannot be contained in any convenient linguistic, geographical, or thematic definition.<br><br>Charting the shifting ideologies and styles of this century--from the flamboyant wit of Samuel Selvon to the deceptive simplicity of Jamaica Kincaid--<em>The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories</em> delivers a wealth of satisfactions in a single volume with unprecedented range.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stewart Brown</strong> is a poet and critic who teaches African and Caribbean literature at the Centre of West African Studies, University of Birmingham. <strong>John Wickham</strong> is literary editor of the <em>Nation</em> newspaper (Barbados) and editor of <em>Bim</em>, the Caribbean's longest-established literary journal.

The idea of the Bible as "Holy Scripture," a non-negotiable authority straight from God, has prevailed in Western society for some time. And while it provides a firm foundation for centuries of Christian teaching, it denies the depth, variety, and richness of this fascinating text. In <i>A History of the Bible</i>, John Barton argues that the Bible is not a prescription to a complete, fixed religious system, but rather a product of a long and intriguing process, which has inspired Judaism and Christianity, but still does not describe the whole of either religion. Barton shows how the Bible is indeed an important source of religious insight for Jews and Christians alike, yet argues that it must be read in its historical context--from its beginnings in myth and folklore to its many interpretations throughout the centuries. <br><br>It is a book full of narratives, laws, proverbs, prophecies, poems, and letters, each with their own character and origin stories. Barton explains how and by whom these disparate pieces were written, how they were canonized (and which ones weren't), and how they were assembled, disseminated, and interpreted around the world--and, importantly, to what effect. Ultimately, <i>A History of the Bible</i> argues that a thorough understanding of the history and context of its writing encourages religious communities to move away from the Bible's literal wording--which is impossible to determine--and focus instead on the broader meanings of scripture.</p><p><b>John Barton</b> is a theologian who served as the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford in England for twenty-three years, and has been an ordained and serving priest in the Church of England since 1973. He has studied and taught the Bible throughout his academic career, and has written many books on it, including <i>Ethics in Ancient Israel</i> and <i>The Bible: The Basics</i>. He is the editor in chief of the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion. He lives in Abingdon, United Kingdom.<b>1</b><br><b> Ancient Israel: History and Language</b><br><br>The Bible comes to us from the world of the eastern Mediterranean.<br> Much of what Christians call the Old Testament was written in what is<br> now Israel/Palestine, the majority probably in Jerusalem. Some may<br> come from Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq), to which many Jews were<br> exiled in the sixth century BCE, and some perhaps from Egypt, where a<br> substantial Jewish community lived from the same period onwards. It is<br> conceivable that there are passages in the Old Testament as old as the<br> tenth or eleventh centuries BCE, but modern scholars tend to think that<br> the eighth century &#x2013; possibly the age also of Homer &#x2013; is the earliest<br> likely period; the latest Old Testament book (Daniel) comes from the<br> second century BCE.<br> There may already be some surprises here. It is widely believed that<br> large parts of the Bible are much older than this implies, with the stories<br> about characters such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the book of Genesis<br> going back into the second millennium BCE. The story the Bible<br> tells does indeed span a very long period; but the books that describe it<br> almost certainly do not date back in written form to such remote antiquity<br> themselves. For the early stories in Genesis, and even the accounts<br> of the activity of Moses in Exodus, we probably have a written version<br> of tales that originally circulated by word of mouth in a mostly illiterate<br> culture, though some biblical scholars think they are deliberate fiction.<br> (It is noticeable that Moses and his predecessors are scarcely mentioned<br> again until literature that we are sure derives from the sixth century<br> BCE, notably Isaiah 40&#x2013; 55.) The story of the origins of Israel, then, is<br> at best folk-memory, which is unlikely to be accurate in any detail across<br> more than a generation or so. This means that we have little access to<br> the history of Israel in the times covered by the opening books of the<br> Bible, the Pentateuch (Greek for &#x2018;five scrolls&#x2019;, and meaning Genesis,<br> Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy).<br> At the other end of the chronology, it is also not generally known that<br> there are Old Testament books more recent than Greek tragedies or the<br> works of Plato and Aristotle. This is partly because later books tend to<br> claim an older ancestry: Ecclesiastes (Qohelet in Hebrew) seems to claim<br> to be by Solomon, who lived in the tenth century BCE, and Daniel claims<br> to be a near- contemporary of Jeremiah, living in the time of the exile in<br> the sixth century BCE. But the general consensus now is that both books<br> are the product of a much later period, and in the case of Daniel a time<br> as late as the age of the Maccabees, Jewish freedom fighters in the second<br> century BCE who went on to found a dynasty. Thus the Old Testament<br> does not derive from a single period in the history of Israel, but from a<br> wide range of dates as well as a variety of places. It is the national literature<br> of a small nation: Israel is about the same size as Wales, or the state<br> of Maine. Before modern times, Israel had a genuinely independent<br> existence for only a few centuries, from perhaps the tenth to the seventh<br> century BCE, and was otherwise subject to the main regional powers &#x2013;<br> Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia or the Hellenistic kingdoms that controlled<br> the Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE.<br> Israel was itself a geopolitically unimportant state, but it lay at the heart<br> of various trade routes in the Middle East and so was open to influences<br> from its larger and more significant neighbours.<br> If we are to understand the development of its national literature, it<br> is necessary to have in mind an outline history of Israel within the wider<br> ancient Near Eastern world. But the history as reconstructed by modern<br> historians differs markedly from the story the Old Testament itself tells.<br> We begin by sketching this story, and then proceed to the modern<br> reconstructions.<br> The Old Testament gives the impression that the origins of the people of<br> Israel do indeed go back well into the second millennium BCE. Abraham,<br> Isaac and Jacob, and Joseph and his eleven brothers, live well<br> before the time of Moses, which in turn is long before the first Kings of<br> Israel, Saul, David and Solomon. In Genesis, the ancestors migrate from<br> Mesopotamia to the Promised Land but continue to have connections<br> with their relatives to the east. They then move to Egypt in a time of<br> famine, Joseph having gone ahead of them as a slave who becomes a<br> major Egyptian official. Chronological notes in the Old Testament<br> suggest that we are meant to think of this as happening in perhaps the<br> fourteenth century BCE. The people return to the Land, this time from<br> the west, from Egypt, under the leadership of Moses; after wandering<br> in the desert for forty years and receiving the Ten Commandments and<br> the other laws, they finally enter the Land with Joshua at their head. By<br> the eleventh century or so they have settled down in the Land under the<br> people the Old Testament calls the &#x2018;judges&#x2019;, tribal leaders who rose to<br> rule the whole of Israel. They face opposition from other local peoples<br> such as the Midianites. It is the Philistines, however, incomers who have<br> settled in the west of the Land (where the Gaza Strip is now), who present<br> the first major challenge; a local leader called Saul rises to the<br> occasion, repels the Philistines and becomes the first king of all the<br> tribes in the north of the Land, excluding the southern tribe of Judah.<br> David, a Judahite from Bethlehem, takes over from Saul when Saul is<br> killed in battle with the Philistines, and unites Judah and Israel to make<br> a single kingdom with its capital at Jerusalem. The union is unstable,<br> and always a source of tension. Under David and his son Solomon,<br> Israel then expands to dominate the surrounding small nations such as<br> Moab, Ammon, Edom and even Aram (now Syria), and we can speak of<br> an Israelite empire. Solomon also constructs a royal temple in Jerusalem<br> as a centre for the worship of God.<br> This is the high point of the history of Israel as the Old Testament sees<br> it. After the death of Solomon the old north- south divide reasserts itself,<br> and there are two kingdoms, Judah and the northern kingdom of Israel,<br> sometimes referred to as Ephraim after the name of the main tribe that<br> had settled in the area it covered. It is Judah that really interests the Old<br> Testament writers, who (we may surmise) lived mostly in Jerusalem. Still<br> there are stories of the north too, such as the tales of the prophets Elijah<br> and Elisha, who work under various northern kings in the ninth century,<br> including the notorious Ahab and his queen, Jezebel &#x2013; regarded by the<br> Old Testament&#x2019;s second book of Kings as apostates from the true Israelite<br> religion and worshippers of the god Baal. Israel is continually at war<br> with Aram, inconclusively so, throughout the century, but in the eighth<br> century the rising power of Assyria, with its capital at Nineveh (near<br> modern Mosul), snuffs out the northern kingdom.<br> The king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria; for three<br> years he besieged it. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured<br> Samaria; he carried the Israelites away to Assyria. (2 Kings 17: 5&#x2013; 6)<br> Judah survives, the Bible tells us, as a tiny independent state until the<br> beginning of the sixth century when it in turn falls to the Babylonians,<br> who have by now supplanted Assyria. The Temple is destroyed, and the<br> land devastated. So begins the Jewish exile, with all the leadership either<br> executed or transported to Babylonia, and only &#x2018;the poorest of the people<br> of the land&#x2019; (2 Kings 25:12) left behind.<br> The Old Testament speaks of a number of important figures from the<br> exilic age, notably Jeremiah and Ezekiel, but tells us little of what the<br> exiles in general did or suffered. Later in the sixth century the conquest<br> of Babylon under its last king, Nabonidus, by the Persian monarch<br> Cyrus the Great leads to a different imperial policy, under which exiled<br> peoples are allowed to return to their homelands.<br> &#x2018;Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given<br> me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a<br> house at Jerusalem in Judah. Any of those among you who are of his<br> people &#x2013; may their God be with them! &#x2013; are now permitted to go up to<br> Jerusalem in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel.&#x2019;<br> (Ezra 1: 2&#x2013; 3)<br> Accordingly a number of Jews return to Judah and begin to rebuild<br> the Temple (known usually as the Second Temple, to distinguish it from<br> the original built by Solomon). We read of some of their activities in the<br> books of Ezra and Nehemiah, who are presented as regulating Jewish<br> life under the Torah &#x2013; the great law book given by God, which we are<br> probably meant to understand as the Pentateuch. After Nehemiah we<br> learn little more of the Persian period, and the Old Testament gives the<br> impression that the significant history of Israel, guided by its God, is<br> more or less over. Only the book of Esther purports to tell of Jewish<br> life under the Persians.<br> Persia was conquered by Alexander the Great (at the end of the<br> fourth century, in 333 BCE, at the Battle of Issus), and there is more<br> information about Jewish life in the Land under his successors in the<br> books of Maccabees.* From them we learn that one successor of Alexander,<br> Antiochus IV Epiphanes, tried to stamp out Judaism in the early<br> second century BCE, but was resisted by Judah Maccabee and his<br> brothers. From the Jewish historian Josephus we gather that their<br> descendants established a new royal dynasty in Jerusalem, the first time<br>since the exile that the Jews had been ruled by a Jewish king. But this<br> information does not come from the Old Testament itself, where the<br> story of Israel peters out in the Persian age.<br> There is probably not a single episode in the history of Israel as told by<br> the Old Testament on which modern scholars are in agreement. Some<br> take a conservative position, treating the Old Testament narrative as<br> likely to be accurate unless there is proof to the contrary, and tend to<br> regard even the stories of early Israel (before the monarchy) as broadly<br> true. Others, commonly referred to as minimalists, think that the story<br> is mostly fiction; some even believe that little of it was written before the<br> age of Alexander and his successors, in the fourth or early third century.<br>&nbsp;Most Old Testament scholars fall between these two extremes.<br> Dating biblical material is extraordinarily difficult, and we have no<br> manuscripts that go back into biblical times: the earliest are the Dead<br> Sea Scrolls, from the second century BCE at the earliest, so dating can<br> only be based on the contents of the biblical books, their style and their<br> vocabulary &#x2013; not on hard evidence such as the date of actual scrolls. So<br> it is impossible to establish a complete consensus, and hard to avoid the<br> impression that much reconstruction of the history of Israel depends on<br> the temperaments of the scholars involved, whether sceptical or credulous,<br> and often also on their religious stance &#x2013; committed, indifferent, or<br> hostile to the Bible as Scripture, that is, as a sacred text with the characteristics<br> summarized above. We might despair of knowing anything<br> worthwhile about the history, and hence (which is what concerns us<br> here) of having a solid historical framework within which to decide<br> when the various books of the Bible are likely to have been written. If<br> there is no agreed history of the nation, then the history of its national<br> literature cannot be written either.<br> This is unduly pessimistic. In fact the history of Israel can be reconstructed<br> in some periods, and we can often tell when the biblical narrative<br> approaches fiction and when it has roots in historical reality. The early<br> history &#x2013; that is, the period before the rise of the monarchy &#x2013; is genuinely<br> sketchy. The Bible presents the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his<br> twelve sons) and the generation led by Moses as successive: Abraham<br> comes to the Land, his descendants go to Egypt, then they return<br> again under Moses. But we might detect here underlying, alternative traditions. Some of Israel&#x2019;s ancestors came from the east, from Mesopotamia<br> or Syria, while others came from the west, from Egypt. Some<br> scholars suggest that the Bible has arranged the traditions so as to give<br> an impression that a single people had both experiences, but behind the<br> unified story there lie two different stories belonging to two different<br> groups. Common to both groups is the belief that the Israelites were not<br> native to Palestine, but were incomers from elsewhere, and this seems to<br> be firmly fixed in the traditions behind the Pentateuch. But the stories<br> reflect the experiences and folk memories of people settling in the Land<br> in the period we associate with the judges, the time just before the monarchy,<br> rather than telling us much about the second millennium BCE.<br> There is one reference to &#x2018;Israel&#x2019; on a stele (victory inscription) found in<br> Thebes in Egypt in 1896, belonging to the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah<br> and probably dated to about 1215 BCE, which indicates that a people<br> calling itself by that name was already in Palestine in the thirteenth century,<br> at that time under Egyptian rule. But we are told nothing more<br> about them, and Israel is never mentioned again in any ancient Egyptian<br> texts.<br> In the twentieth century some biblical archaeologists developed the<br> theory that the stories of the patriarchs reflected customs known from<br> second- millennium BCE texts &#x2013; Mesopotamian documents, from the<br> cities of Mari and Nuzu &#x2013; rather than those current in later times in<br> Israel. Hence, they argued, the stories must be genuine, or at least rest<br> on traditions from that period. For example, there are three stories in<br> Genesis where one of the patriarchs passes his wife off as his sister,<br> which results in her being taken into the harem of a foreign ruler, to<br> avoid his being killed (Genesis 12, 20, and 26):<br> When he [Abram] was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, &#x2018;I<br> know well that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, and when the<br> Egyptians see you they will say, &#x201c;This is his wife&#x201d;; then they will kill me,<br> but let you live. Say that you are my sister, so that it may go well with me<br> because of you, and that my life may be spared on your account.&#x2019;<br> (Genesis 12: 11&#x2013; 13)<br> It was argued that in Mari marriage between brother and sister did in<br> fact occur, whereas in later times in Israel it was regarded as incestuous.<br> Thus these stories would have to be &#x2018;pre-historic&#x2019;, and that would mean<br> that we do have some information about the earliest ancestors of the<br> Israelites. More recently, however, this line of reasoning has b...</p><h2>The Human Career: Human Biological and Cultural Origins, Third Edition</h2><p><p>Since its publication in 1989, <i>The Human Career</i> has proved to be an indispensable tool in teaching human origins.

But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>First published in 1885, Stevenson&#39;s verses so truly reflect the feelings of young children--about being small, the bliss of going up in a swing so high, discovering one&#39;s shadow, happiness and sorrow and dreaming--that they have never ceased to be an essential part of a child&#39;s library. Robinson&#39;s beautiful pictures originally appeared in 1896 in the first illustrated edition.</p><h2>Amulets of Ancient Egypt</h2><p><blockquote> <p>"This handy reference work covers everything most of us could ever want to know about the subject of ancient Egyptian daily-life and after-life charms, and should be on the shelf of every good personal library devoted to topics Egyptological." </p> <p>&#x2014;KMT</p> </blockquote> <p> Amulets are ornaments believed to endow the wearer by magical means with the properties they represent. They were first made in Egypt as early as 4000 BC and were essential adornments for both the living and the dead. Crafted from gold and silver, semiprecious stones, and less valuable materials, they are fine examples of Egyptian art as well as a vital source of evidence for religious beliefs. </p> <p> In this book, Carol Andrews offers the first comprehensive account of the types of amulets made, their symbolism, and their protective powers. An amuletic foot could be worn to ensure fleetness of foot, a hand for dexterity. The desert-dwelling hare symbolized keenness of the senses, and the hedgehog, which hibernated and survived outside the fertile valley, held connotations of rebirth and triumph over death itself. The ubiquitous amulet in the shape of the dung beetle, known as a scarab, was symbolic of new life. Amulets in the image of powerful gods would be worn for protection, and malevolent creatures, like the male hippopotamus, would be worn to ward off the evil they represented. </p> <p> Both a reference book and an informative account of Egyptian magical belief, this is the most complete survey of the subject to date. </p></p><p>Carol Andrews is a curator in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities, British Museum.This handy reference work covers everything most of us could ever want to know about the subject of ancient Egyptian daily-life and after-life charms, and should be on the shelf of every good personal library devoted to topics Egyptological.</p><h2>America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

It is crucial to self-regulation and constructive, intimate relationships. Failure to retain mentalizing, particularly in the midst of emotional interactions, is a core problem in borderline personality disorder and results in severe emotional fluctuations, impulsivity, and vulnerability to interpersonal and social interactions. Mentalization-based treatment for borderline personality disorder is a &#39;How to Do It&#39; book outlining a clinically proven treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder. Containing illustrative clinical examples, it details precisely how to develop and implement treatment and is a companion to the highly successful book Psychotherapy for Borderline Personality Disorder - mentalization based treatment. This practical guide explains how to treat borderline patients by helping them develop a more robust mentalizing capacity within the context of an attachment relationship. It provides the practitioner with everything they need to know about how to practise mentalizing treatment in day patient and out-patient settings. Enough theory is provided to orientate the clinician and there is step-by-step practical advice on the assessment of mentalizing and interpersonal relationships, how to structure treatment, the use of basic mentalizing interventions and how to apply them, as well as information on what not to do. In addition, it includes a check list to be used in the assessment of mentalizing and a self-rating exercise for practitioners to evaluate their adherence to mentalizing.</p><p>Prof. Anthony Bateman is Director of Psychotherapy Services and Research Lead for personality disorder at St Ann&#39;s Hospital, North London and Visiting Professor at University College, London.

We glance for a brief moment at whatever catches our eye and then move on. <i>Slow Reading in a Hurried Age</i> reminds us of another mode of reading--the kind that requires our full attention and that has as its goal not the mere gathering of information but the deeper understanding that only good books can offer.</p><p><i>Slow Reading in a Hurried Age</i> is a practical guide for anyone who yearns for a more meaningful and satisfying reading experience, and who wants to sharpen reading skills and improve concentration. David Mikics, a noted literary scholar, demonstrates exactly how the tried-and-true methods of slow reading can provide a more immersive, fulfilling experience. He begins with fourteen preliminary rules for slow reading and shows us how to apply them. The rules are followed by excursions into key genres, including short stories, novels, poems, plays, and essays.</p><p>Reading, Mikics says, should not be drudgery, and not mere escape either, but a way to live life at a higher pitch. A good book is a pathway to finding ourselves, by getting lost in the words and works of others.</p></p><p>David Mikics is John and Rebecca Moores Professor of English at the University of Houston.Like [Charles] Lamb, <b>Mikics</b> understands how modern culture discourages reading for pleasure--especially in an Internet world of short-lived but insistent information. Inviting readers into a less frenetic, more rewarding world, Mikics explores a series of literary masterpieces, showing how getting lost in a book is still the best way to find joys we really want...Readers acquire stimulating perspectives on individual works by Homer and Whitman, Dickens and Cather, Shakespeare and Chekov. But they also develop the intellectual poise to set one work into play with others, across boundaries of nationality, style, and history. An exceptional book whetting readers' appetites for the savoring of many more.<br> (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist (starred review)</i> 2013-09-15)<br><br><b>Mikics</b> writes accessibly and with infectious enthusiasm on an impressively eclectic range of classic and contemporary texts. The reader who picks up this volume will likely already have been won over to Mikics's argument, but the book's pedagogical value for students is considerable.<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2013-08-05)<br><br>There is nothing else like <i>Slow Reading in a Hurried Age</i>. <b>Mikics</b>'s fourteen rules are quite wonderful, and I will in teaching adopt them myself. (Harold Bloom)<br><br>There is much solid wisdom and penetrating advice in these pages. <b>David Mikics</b> is an inspired teacher, and he has brought his rich pedagogic imagination to life in this book, which teaches us to fall in love again with great literature. The examples are wonderfully apt and wide-ranging. (Phillip Lopate, Hofstra University)<br><br>It may seem counterintuitive to read a book on slow reading in order to help you read more efficiently. But that's exactly what you stand to gain by (slowly) reading...<b>Mikics</b>' wise, common-sense guide to getting the most out of real reading--totally immersive reading...I can't recommend this book highly enough.<br> (<i>West Australian</i> 2013-10-08)<br><br><b>Mikics</b> insists that we are not in a world of declining reading, but quite the opposite. People are inundated with words that they feel compelled to read--in email, in tweets, in posts to social networking sites, in text messages--so much so that they can barely keep up. So we read fast and carelessly and we prize brevity at the expense of substance, a habit that is making all of us increasingly unable to concentrate on what is directly in front of us, constantly distracted as we are by pop-ups, embedded links, and the whole range of digital items that make constant demands on our time and attention...The choice of materials is eclectic but one of the finest achievements of the volume is how compellingly, but undogmatically, it makes the case for a literary canon, one not born of professorial or other fiat but of merit...The greatest strength of the volume is that in modeling slow reading of exemplary works of literature, it fosters exactly the qualities that such reading requires: sustained attention, attentiveness to detail, a willingness and ability to accommodate a gradually building realization of the significance of a given work.<br> (James Williams <i>PopMatters</i> 2013-10-07)<br><br>A step-by-step guide to reading books amid the rushing world of an information-obsessed era. The book guides the reader through what amounts to a sort of extended independent study with a very approachable and patient professor. (Ian Stansel <i>Ploughshares online</i> 2013-10-28)<br><br>This addition to the growing store of literary how-to books opens with the stuff of countless essays and op-ed pieces: too much information, not enough concentration, it is time to slow down. All this functions as a preamble to advice about what to do after the smartphone is turned off: read more patiently and thereby rescue interior depth from the decentering storm of digital text. So although it serves as an introduction to practical criticism, it is also a work of moral improvement, primarily aimed not at students, the captive goal-oriented audience with teachers to please, but at adults with demanding, other-directed lives that hem in the room for contemplation. <b>David Mikics</b>&#x2019; relaxed point that we like to identify with characters in novels puts it plainly: reading is done self to self. (Owen Richardson <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> 2013-11-30)<br><br>The problem [<b>Mikics</b>] addresses is very real, the rules he proposes make sense, and he is a perceptive reader...Expect a run on this book; it should prove popular in English classes at all levels, from high school and up. (David Keymer <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2013-12-15)<br><br>Beautifully and unabashedly edifying...<b>Mikics</b> is up to something more than just technical instruction. What separates <i>Slow Reading in a Hurried Age </i>from other popular or academic how-to guides is Mikics&#x2019;s urgent reverence for literature, which he wants to impress upon the reader. To read well, he clearly believes, is not just to master a skill; it is to become a certain kind of person...Mikics, in calm, authoritative prose, lays out the case that the way we read now is in many cases the enemy of reading as it is supposed to be...<i>Slow Reading in a Hurried Age </i>is a guide to becoming a great reader. This is a very hard thing to teach: so much of what happens when we read is internal and instinctive, and it is hard to transform reactions into rules. But Mikics manages to do exactly that... The gift of Mikics&#x2019;s book at the right moment could lead to a lifetime of good, slow reading.

The book begins with a chapter on everyday life, which consists of thank yous and other written and spoken words, privacy, greetings and introductions, and techno-manners. The treatment of chat rooms, message boards, e-mail, pagers, and computers offers guidelines that protect users while facilitating positive, healthy interactions. Subsequent chapters take on family relations within the home, situations at school, social events, manners at the mall and concerts, hospital visits, religious events and weddings, and travel. Eating out, whether fast food or fine dining, is covered, as are funerals, taxis, and interacting with a person with a disability. The writing is clear, friendly, and sometimes clever, putting readers at ease and raising myriad possibilities through the use of "what if" scenarios, complete with possible dialogue and even multiple-choice answers.

He is the author of 30 books, including Shelley&#39;s Mythmaking (1959), The Visionary Company (1961), Blake&#39;s Apocalypse (1963), Yeats (1970), A Map of Misreading (1975), Kabbalah and Criticism (1975), Agon: Toward a Theory of Revisionism (1982), The American Religion (1992), The Western Canon (1994), and Omens of Millennium: The Gnosis of Angels, Dreams, and Resurrection (1996). The Anxiety of Influence (1973) sets forth Professor Bloom&#39;s provocative theory of the literary relationships between the great writers and their predecessors. His most recent books include Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human (1998), a 1998 National Book Award finalist, How to Read and Why (2000), Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds (2002), Hamlet: Poem Unlimited (2003), Where Shall Wisdom be Found (2004), and Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine (2005). In 1999, Professor Bloom received the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal for Criticism. He has also received the International Prize of Catalonia, the Alfonso Reyes Prize of Mexico, and the Hans Christian Andersen Bicentennial Prize of Denmark.Grade 10 Up?A solid tool for the study of William Golding's classic novel. Sixteen critical selections from both journals and books are arranged in chronological order by date of publication from 1961 to 1993. The examined topics, length and completeness of entries, and depth of analysis present a wide range of material. Articles selected by Bloom have not previously appeared in works easily accessible to most readers. There is little duplication with "Contemporary Literary Criticism" (Gale) or with "British Writers" (Scribners); both cover less ground. Clarice Swisher's Readings on Lord of the Flies (Greenhaven, 1997) includes two of the same critics, but Bloom's book has complete articles rather than excerpts. While some readers may struggle with these selections, the book is an excellent resource.?Gail Richmond, San Diego Unified Schools, CA<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>About Town: The New Yorker and The World It Made (First Edition)</h2><p>Offers a critical and cultural history of &#34;The New Yorker&#34; from its founding in 1919 through 1987, discussing the evolution of the magazine&#39;s content over the years and its role in American cultural life</p><p><i>"</i>The New Yorker <i>will be the magazine which is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque."</i><p> This now-famous line first appeared in the prospectus Harold Ross wrote for a humor magazine he was hoping to start, and, in fact, epitomized the publication's early years. For, as contributing editor E.B. White once ruefully wrote in response to a query about what kind of submissions were wanted, "I myself have only the vaguest idea what sort of manuscripts <i>The New Yorker</i> wants. I have, however, a pretty clear idea of what it <i>doesn't</i> want." </p><p> Plenty of books have been written about <i>The New Yorker</i> over the years--many by people who were intimately connected with it. Ben Yagoda's <i>About Town</i> is the first, however, to concentrate on the magazine itself, rather than the personalities who shaped it. In his introduction Yagoda writes: "What I had in mind was a critical and cultural history. It would consider, first, the <i>content</i> of the magazine--how its original form came to be, and how and why it evolved over the years. Second, I would look at the role the <i>New Yorker</i> has played in American cultural life." Yagoda is as good as his word as he takes readers from the founding of the magazine in 1919 up until 1987, the year William Shawn was forcibly retired from his position as editor in chief. An epilogue covers the Robert Gottlieb, Tina Brown, and David Remnick years, but the author considers that with Shawn's departure, the curtain came down on <i>The New Yorker</i> as "a unique and influential institution in our culture." </p><p> Of course devotees of Harold Ross's brainchild could be expected to eat this book up, but <i>About Town</i> is more than just the story of how a magazine was made. Yagoda provides a window on a lost age--New York in the '20s, '30s, and '40s before the advent of television, when magazines and newspapers were at the center of the nation's cultural and intellectual life. He writes well, evoking the times, the people, and the places with such clarity that Harold Ross himself would have been pleased. And it is to Ross that Yagoda and the reader owe much of <i>About Town</i>, for it seems <i>The New Yorker</i>'s founding editor kept meticulous records--as did those with whom he worked. When S.I. Newhouse took control of the magazine in 1985, its editorial files--all 2,500 archival boxes of them--ended up at the New York Public Library. Letters from editors to writers and vice versa, minutes from art meetings, memos, editorial queries, and marked-up manuscripts are the raw materials from which Yagoda shapes his story, and he tells it so well that it often reads like a novel. The section dealing with the magazine's decision to run John Hersey's <i>Hiroshima</i> in its entirety is positively gripping. </p><p> But perhaps the best thing about <i>About Town</i>--for those readers who, like Alice in Wonderland, demand pictures and conversations in their stories--is the plethora of memorable quotes (and even a few photographs) that bring to life <i>The New Yorker</i> in its heyday. Consider this letter from Vladimir Nabokov concerning a short story the magazine had bought: </p><blockquote> A man called Ross started to "edit" it, and I wrote to Mrs. White telling her that I could not accept <i>any</i> of those ridiculous and exasperating alterations (odds and ends inserted in order to "link up" ideas and make them clear to the "average reader"). Nothing like it has ever happened to me in my life. </blockquote> Or this snippet from Ross's letter to H.L. Mencken: "We have carried editing to a very high degree of fussiness here, probably to a point approaching the ultimate. I don't know how to get it under control." <p> Lovers of <i>The New Yorker</i> can thank their stars that Harold Ross never <i>did</i> get his fussiness under control. And they can thank Ben Yagoda for writing this comprehensive and satisfying biography of one of America's most enduring literary institutions. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Ben Yagoda</b> is the author of <i>Will Rogers: A Biography</i> and co-editor of <i>The Art of Fact: A Historical Anthology of Literary Journalism. </i> He is a regular contributor to numerous national publications.

In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i> (1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California fictions, <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932) and <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <i>The Long Valley</i> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <i>Tortilla Flat</i> (1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s <i>paisanos</i>. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <i>In Dubious Battle</i> (1936), <i>Of Mice and Men</i> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1939). Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <i>The Forgotten Village</i> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <i>Sea of Cortez</i> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing <i>Bombs Away</i> (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <i>The Moon Is Down</i> (1942). <i>Cannery Row</i> (1945), <i>The Wayward Bus</i> (1947), <i>The Pearl</i> (1947), <i>A Russian Journal</i> (1948), another experimental drama, <i>Burning Bright</i> (1950), and <i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <i>East of Eden</i> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history. The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <i>Sweet Thursday</i> (1954), <i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i> (1957), <i>Once There Was a War</i> (1958), <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> (1961), <i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> (1962), <i>America and Americans</i> (1966), and the posthumously published <i>Journal of a Novel: The</i> East of Eden <i>Letters</i> (1969), <i>Viva Zapata!</i> (1975), <i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i> (1976), and <i>Working Days: The Journals of</i> The Grapes of Wrath (1989).

When he shipped out as a correspondent in 1943, he was already world famous for <i>The Grapes of Wrath,</i> which had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature and turned into a popular and acclaimed film. He was too old for the draft at age forty-one, and was living an enviable professional life, with publishers eager for his next novel and Hollywood as his playground. He was a celebrity. Newspapers had covered every detail of his recent divorce and remarriage, and when he decided to leave his bride in New York in order to help cover the war, that, too, was news.</p><p>So why go to war? Patriotism was part of it. Steinbeck had benefited early in his career by some of the New Deal programs for writers and artists during the Depression, and may have felt a desire to give something back, to use his talent to further the &#x201c;War Effort,&#x201d; a concept he described with typically wry insight in the introduction to this volume. But perhaps the deeper reason was the urge felt by most men in those years to &#x201c;see action,&#x201d; to play some role in, if only to witness, the sweeping historical drama of the age. The world was traumatically changing shape, and to be on the sidelines must have felt like being dealt out of the future. Recruited directly by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the novelist first contributed by writing propaganda&#x2014;perhaps the most talented hack ever pressed into such service. He wrote a novel, <i>The Moon Is Down,</i> for a precursor to the CIA, and the book <i>Bombs</i> <i>Away,</i> about a bomber crew, for the Office of War Information. But when Steinbeck pressed for work closer to the front lines, he was told he would need to be commissioned as a military officer. As if determined to prove that there is no boon too great for government bureaucracy to squander, his request to become an air force intelligence officer was scuttled by his local draft board in California, which concluded on the basis of rumor and suspicion alone that the author of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> was sufficiently &#x201c;communistic&#x201d; to be regarded as a security risk. Thwarted, Steinbeck complained to friends at a dinner party in New York, lamenting that he would &#x201c;never see the war.&#x201d; He was promptly offered the job of correspondent for the <i>New York Herald Tribune.</i></p><p>His six-month stint produced these reports, which show that for all his acclaim as a novelist, Steinbeck had not lost his humility as a writer. His reporting shows the same extraordinary empathy for the common man that ran so deep in all his work. There is a point he makes repeatedly in these dispatches, and it is this: The closer you get to war, the less you know about what is going on. He quotes a soldier, &#x201c;I remember before I joined up I used to know everything that was happening. I knew what Turkey was doing. I even had maps with pins and I drew out campaigns with colored pencils. Now I haven&#x2019;t looked at a paper in two weeks.&#x201d; Close to action one sees only what is happening in the immediate vicinity, and in action that perspective is all one can afford.</p><p>It is a different thing, then, to be at war than to be observing and watching it from a safe distance. Steinbeck surrendered any attempt to understand the big picture, and immersed himself. Nowhere in these reports are there assessments or critiques of campaign strategy or accounts of massive troop movements. With the novelist we are simply <i>in</i> the war, swept along with millions of our countrymen. And like the others, mostly what we experience is neither thrilling nor terrible. Steinbeck understood that for most soldiers, the real experience of the war involved a lot of sitting around and waiting, often in unfamiliar and uncomfortable places, with many other men in the same boat.</p><p>In England, where forces were massed for the coming great assault on France and Germany, correspondents had already been competing for years over every scrap of news and every obvious feature story. Many journalists considered the place tapped out. Yet Steinbeck immediately found new material by focusing on things that &#x201c;serious&#x201d; journalists might regard as insignificant, and filling his accounts with workmanlike description, such as this meticulous picture of the barracks housing a Flying Fortress bomber crew: &#x201c;The room is long and narrow and unpainted. Against each side wall are iron double-decker bunks, alternating with clothes lockers. A long rack in the middle between the bunks serves as a hanger for winter coats and raincoats. Next to it is the rack of rifles and submachine guns of the crew.&#x201d; Details that would escape the eye of most reporters captured his, like the little gray dog that is &#x201c;almost a Scottie,&#x201d; who knew exactly which of the returning bombers carried his crew and would race out to greet it the moment it landed. Far more than the particulars of troop movements or the pronouncements of generals, far more than news of small victories or defeats, Steinbeck knew his readers craved stories that captured what the war looked like, how it sounded, how it smelled, how it felt. Millions of fathers, mothers, sisters, girlfriends, and wives were desperate to better understand the experience of their warriors overseas. So in each column of only eight hundred to a thousand words, Steinbeck crafted a picture in language out of the places he visited and the characters he met. He listened for the fears, joys, rumors, superstitions, and small triumphs and spun them into small stories that defined life in these long, tense months of waiting and preparation.</p></p><h2>Foundations of Osteopathic Medicine</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note:</b> Products purchased from 3rd Party sellers are not guaranteed by the Publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product. <br><br><p>Thoroughly revised for its Third Edition, <b>Foundations of Osteopathic Medicine</b> is the most comprehensive, current osteopathic text.

Jon Lee Anderson&#x2019;s biography traces Che&#x2019;s extraordinary life, from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro&#x2019;s government to his failed campaign in the Congo and assassination in the Bolivian jungle.<br><br>Anderson has had unprecedented access to the personal archives maintained by Guevara&#x2019;s widow and carefully guarded Cuban government documents. He has conducted extensive interviews with Che&#x2019;s comrades some of whom speak here for the first time and with the CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara&#x2019;s body was buried, which led to the exhumation and state burial of the bones. Many of the details of Che&#x2019;s life have long been cloaked in secrecy and intrigue. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, Che Guevara illuminates as never before this mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.<br></p><p><br> Superb . . .

Anderson&#x2019;s book recounts in minute detail the chronology of an obsession.&#x201d; <i>Latin Trade</i><br><br> A sweeping biography of the Latino revolutionary and pop-culture hero.

Attitudes and behaviors of the adolescent can be unhealthy for him and for the family. However, good boundaries are the bedrock of not only better relationships, but also maturity, safety, and growth---especially for teens and their parents. In order to help teenagers grow into healthy adults, parents and youth workers need to help them experience how to take responsibility for their behavior, their values, and their lives. Dr. John Townsend, coauthor of the Gold Medallion Award-winning book Boundaries, is a parent of two teenagers himself. With wisdom and empathy, he applies his biblically based principles to bear on the challenging task of the teen years, showing parents: * How to deal with disrespectful attitudes and irresponsible behaviors in your teen * How to set healthy limits and realistic consequences * How to be loving and caring while establishing rules * How to determine specific strategies to deal with problems both big and small The book begins by giving parents a way to look at adolescence itself, so they can better understand how a teen thinks, feels, and relates to others. Then it provides the nuts and bolts of what boundaries are all about and how to apply them. There are many topically based chapters devoted to specific problems, from moodiness to school problems to aggression. Finally, Townsend addresses the attitudes, conflicts, and difficulties of parents themselves, helping them resolve their own personal obstacles to being an effective maturing force for the teen.

This magnificent book, written by a team of eminent international scholars, is the first to recount the history of Chinese painting over a span of some three thousand years. Drawing on museum collections, archives, and archaeological sites in China&#x2014;including many resources never before available to Western scholars&#x2014;as well as on collections in other countries, the authors present and analyze the very best examples of Chinese painting: more than 300 of them are reproduced here in color. Both accessible to the general reader and revelatory for the scholar, the book provides the most up-to-date and detailed history of China&#x2019;s pictorial art available today.<br><br> In this book the authors rewrite the history of Chinese art wherever it is found&#x2014;in caves, temples, or museum collections. They begin by grounding the Western reader in Chinese traditions and practices, showing in essence how to look at a Chinese painting. They then shed light on such topics as the development of classical and narrative painting, the origins of the literati tradition, the flowering of landscape painting, and the ways the traditions of Chinese painting have been carried into the present day. The book, which concludes with a glossary of techniques and terms and a list of artists by dynasty, is an essential resource for all lovers of, or newcomers to, Chinese painting.<br><br><i>Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting</i> is the inaugural volume in a new series, The Culture<i> &amp;</i> Civilization of China, a joint publishing venture of Yale University Press and the American Council of Learned Societies with the China International Publishing Group in Beijing. The undertaking will ultimately result in the publication of more than seventy-five volumes on the visual arts, classical literature, language, and philosophy, as well as several comprehensive reference volumes.</p><p>This book is a rare feat: seldom is an art history--much less an ambitious, 400-page chronicle of one of the great cultural achievements of the last three millennia--as much a delight for the amateur lover of art as it is indispensable for the student of the field. Written by three eminent specialists in the United States and three in China, <i>Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting</i> combines the best of both countries' scholarly approaches with new discoveries and illustrations of numerous paintings located in China and previously little known abroad.<p> Insightful, often lively discussions tell the story in six chapters, mostly dynastic, after briefly giving two "approaches" to Chinese painting. History, politics, biography, and training get their proper due and are complemented by often-detailed analyses of individual artworks. Close attention to the text and the 300 color and 25 black-and-white illustrations enable the reader to "see" these paintings--which are often constructed on different perceptual and cultural premises than the post-Renaissance and photographic images by which most Westerners structure their visual vocabulary. The glossary and other tools are welcome aids; the list of artists is organized by period and offers their names in the two most common romanization systems as well as in Chinese characters. And to read James Cahill on the Ni Zan paintings that may at first appear uninviting, or Lang Shaojun on the proportionally numerous 20th-century painters, is a real adventure for both the eye and the mind.</p><p> Anyone with more than a passing interest in one of the world's most esteemed art traditions--be they a Sunday museumgoer or a confirmed lover of the gnarly pines set amidst the towering mountains of the Song-period masters--will want this book in their library. <i>--Joseph N. Newland</i></p>Published in association with Foreign Languages Press, Beijing <p>The Culture and Civilization of China Series</p></p><h2>The Castle of Otranto (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p><p>In a faraway medieval realm, Manfred, an arrogant and evil prince, rules with an iron fist. Banishing his wife to the castle dungeon, he confines &#x2014; and plans to wed &#x2014; the lovely Isabella, fianc�e of his recently deceased son. The prince's plans are foiled, however, when a well-meaning peasant helps the young woman escape through the castle's underground passages. Grisly, supernatural events further aid in fulfilling a prophecy that spells doom for the prince and justice for Isabella's rescuer and rightful heir to the throne.<br>One of the first and greatest of Gothic novels, this thrilling tale ranks among the most influential books in literary history. Serving as the model for plots, characterizations, settings, and tone for hundreds of successors, <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> abounds with colorful scenes, adventure, suspense, and inexplicable phenomena.<br></p><p></p></p><p>This Broadview edition pairs the first Gothic novel with the first Gothic drama, both by Horace Walpole. Published on Christmas Eve, 1764, on Walpole's private press at Strawberry Hill, his Gothicized country house, The Castle of Otranto became an instant and immediate classic of the Gothic genre as well as the prototype for Gothic fiction for the next two hundred years. Walpole's brooding and intense drama, The Mysterious Mother, focuses on the protagonist's angst over an act of incest with his mother, and includes the appearance of Father Benedict, Gothic literature's first evil monk. Appendices in this edition include selections from Walpole&#x2019;s letters, contemporary responses, and writings illustrating the aesthetic and intellectual climate of the period. Also included is Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s introduction to the 1811 edition of The Castle of Otranto.Horatio Walpole (1717 &#x2013;1797), was an English art historian, man of letters, antiquarian and politician. He is now largely remembered for Strawberry Hill, the home he built in Twickenham, south-west London where he revived the Gothic style some decades before his Victorian successors, and for his Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Along with the book, his literary reputation rests on his Letters, which are of significant social and political interest. He was the son of Sir Robert Walpole, and cousin of the 1st Viscount Nelson. His lasting architectural creation is Strawberry Hill, the home he built in Twickenham, south-west London, in which he revived the Gothic style many decades before his Victorian successors. This fanciful neo-Gothic concoction began a new architectural trend. Strawberry Hill had its own printing press which supported Horace Walpole's intensive literary activity. In 1764, not using his own press, he anonymously published his Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, claiming on its title page that it was a translation "from the Original Italian of Onuphirio Muralto". The second edition's preface, according to James Watt, "has often been regarded as a manifesto for the modern Gothic romance, stating that his work, now subtitled 'A Gothic Story', sought to restore the qualities of imagination and invention to contemporary fiction". However, there is a playfulness in the prefaces to both editions and in the narration within the text itself. The novel opens with the son of Manfred (the Prince of Otranto) being crushed under a massive helmet that appears as a result of supernatural causes. However, that moment, along with the rest of the unfolding plot, includes a mixture of both ridiculous and sublime supernatural elements. The plot finally reveals how Manfred's family is tainted in a way that served as a model for successive Gothic plots.</p><h2>My Man Jeeves</h2><p><p>A hapless gentleman, Bertie Wooster, and his all-knowing valet, Jeeves, embark upon a series of humorous hijinks in New York City. </p><p>They encounter a dazzling cast of characters along the way, including cantankerous aunts, amiable aristocrats, and careless cousins. Whether confronted by outlandish plots, Wooster's own buffoonery, or an everyday meeting gone awry, it is always Jeeves who saves the day.</p><p>Masterfully told and hysterically funny throughout, <i>My Man Jeeves </i>marks the hilarious beginning of one of literature's greatest comedy double-acts.</p></p><p>A hapless gentleman, Bertie Wooster, and his all-knowing valet, Jeeves, embark upon a series of humorous hijinks in New York City.

Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

She explores the importance of women&#39;s religious practices along with related themes of family and of social change. Weaving several of her own voices--analytic, descriptive, and personal--with the voices of her subjects in alternate chapters of traditional ethnography and ethnographic fiction, Brown presents herself as a character in Mama Lola&#39;s world and allows the reader to evaluate her interactions there. Startlingly original, Brown&#39;s work endures as an important experiment in ethnography as a social art form rooted in human relationships. A new preface, epilogue, bibliography, and a collection of family photographs tell the story of the effect of the book&#39;s publication on Mama Lola&#39;s life.</p><p>"<i>Mama Lola</i> is about extraordinary people living ordinary lives.

It is intended to be a textbook for students of religious and Asian studies, but it will also be of interest to those who want a general survey of Buddhism and its beliefs. Unlike many other general books about Buddhism, it not only explores the world views of the religion but also attempts to show how Buddhism functions as a set of practices. It thus includes chapters on devotion, ethics, monastic practices and meditation. Such practices are related to Buddhist teachings and historical developments. Emphasizing as it does the diversity found within different Buddhist traditions, the book aims throughout to underline common threads of belief, practice and historical continuities which unify the Buddhist world. Dr. Harvey answers questions that are often asked by people on first meeting the tradition, and in his section on Nirvana offers a novel interpretation of this ultimate, transcendent mystery.</p><p>Unlike other studies, this work not only explores Buddhism&#39;s world views but attempts to show how it functions as a set of practices based on devotion, ethics, and meditation.Peter Harvey is Emeritus Professor of Buddhist Studies at the University of Sunderland.

The academy is shown to be not just a realm of dialogue and debate, but also a sphere of power in which reputations and careers are made, defended and destroyed.<br>Employing the distinctive methods for which he has become well known, Bourdieu examines the social background and practical activities of his fellow academics&#x2015;from Foucault, Derrida, and Lacan to figures who are lesser known but not necessarily less influential. Bourdieu analyzes their social origins and current positions, how much they publish and where they publish it, their institutional connections, media appearances, political involvements and so on. <br>This enables Bourdieu to construct a map of the intellectual field in France and to analyze the forms of capital and power, the lines of conflict and the patterns of change, which characterize the system of higher education in France today.<br><i>Homo Academicus</i> paints a vivid and dynamic picture of French intellectual life today and develops a general approach to the study of modern culture and education. It will be of great interest to students of sociology, education and politics as well as to anyone concerned with the role of intellectuals and higher education today.</p><p>&#x201c;This necessary, powerful, oblique, and misshapen book is part of a grand statement of the sociological imagination. . . .

This Library of America volume and its companion are a fitting testimony to his unprecedented achievement. They offer the only comprehensive collection of his critical writings ever assembled, more than one-third of which have never appeared in book form.<br><br>This first volume focuses especially on his responses to American and English writers; the second volume contains his essays on European literature and the Prefaces to the New York Edition of his fiction.<br><br>From 1864 until virtually the end of his life, James displayed an astonishing range and catholicity of critical interests, touching on nearly every facet of literature in America, England, and Europe. Here are his most important theoretical essays, including his witty and daring declarations of the novelist&#x2019;s freedom in &#x201c;The Art of Fiction,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Future of the Novel,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Science of Criticism&#x201d;&#x2014;a gently ironic title from a writer who regarded criticism as a form of art.<br><br>Appreciations of Ralph Waldo Emerson (&#x201c;I knew he was great, greater than any of our friends&#x201d;), pungent comments (which he later regretted) on Walt Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201c;Drum-Taps,&#x201d; and assessments of Louisa May Alcott, Edgar Allan Poe, his friend and admirer William Dean Howells, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Francis Parkman, and scores of other American writers are joined, in revealing proximity, to commentaries on nearly every important English writer of fiction (and some poets, such as the Brownings) during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br>These reviews of English writers include James&#x2019;s stunning essay on Charles Dickens&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, his provocative discussions of George Eliot, and his tough but appreciative estimates of Anthony Trollope, Matthew Arnold, Benjamin Disraeli, Elizabeth Gaskell, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, William Morris, Rupert Brooke, Ouida, Algernon Charles Swinburne, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Also included here is his great essay on Shakespeare&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Tempest</i>. All of these pieces are gathered under the author considered, so that James&#x2019;s supple changes in attitude can be followed across the years.<br><br>Of particular interest, both critically and biographically, are James&#x2019;s commentaries on Nathaniel Hawthorne, including his still-controversial book-length study of 1879. His estimates of his predecessor&#x2019;s work remain highly debatable, but are perhaps more interesting as evidence of his own feelings about being an American writer of a later and, as he assumed, more complex time.<br><br>Finally, this volume includes two invaluable collections: his &#x201c;American Letters&#x201d; and &#x201c;London Notes,&#x201d; wherein, with unsurpassed tact and grandeur of mind, he introduces readers of his native and of his adopted country to each other.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him. He died in London in February 1916.</p></p><h2>Concerning The True Care of Souls</h2><p>We want to demonstrate to all the pious children of God, who from their hearts pray for the future of the kingdom of Christ, our own duty in this so deplorable scattering of the church.<br><br>The fact that all people have been made by God and are God s creatures should therefore be reason enough for us to go to them, seeking with the utmost faithfulness to bring them to eternal life.<br><br>This is why we have undertaken the writing of this little book concerning all these matters, inserting various quotations from the word of God and, insofar as the Lord has given us grace, explaining them. From these every Christian can thoroughly learn what sort of fellowship the church of Christ is, how Christ the Lord alone rules, what ministry he requires in that rule and how this ministry is to be ordered and performed, in relation to all those who are brought to the church of Christ and wish to be kept and built up in it.<br><br>We have throughout set out the spiritual quotations, so that the Christian reader can himself see the foundation of the word, consider it and lay it up in his heart. For there are not a few who, as soon as anything is said about church discipline and order, are always crying out that we want to bring back the traditions and bondage of men; and so we do not wish to put forward anything other than the obvious and certain teaching and clear undoubted command of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p>Martin Bucer (1491 1551) was one of the most important sixteenth-century Reformers, who became leader of the Reformed Churches in Switzerland and South Germany after the death of Zwingli.</p><h2>Phonics They Use: Words for Reading and Writing (6th Edition) (Making Words Series)</h2><p><p>Written by an outstanding scholar, <i>Phonics They Use,</i> seamlessly weaves together the complex and varied strategic approaches needed to help students develop reading and writing skills and offers a collection of strategies and hands-on activities that provide a framework for teaching phonics.

Feared by many, Grettir is a warrior and also a poet and a lover. Unable to resolve the dispute that has outlawed him, he lives outside the bounds of family life and he roams the countryside, ridding Iceland and Norway of berserker warriors, trolls, and the walking dead. The saga presents a poignant story of medieval Icelandic society, combining details of everyday legal disputes with folklore and legend. With its scathing humor, explicit verses, and fantastic monsters, <em>Grettir's Saga</em> is among the most famous and widely read of Iceland's epics.

S. Grant (Civil War)</h2><p>In 1854, after serving in the U.S. Army for 11 years, Ulysses Simpson Grant (1822-1885) resigned his commission and found himself out of a job and out of money. Over the next seven years he tried his hand at several occupations but succeeded in none. Only the outbreak of the Civil War and Grant&#x2019;s eventual command of the Union Army provided the opportunity to display the military brilliance for which he would best be remembered.<br>Following the war and two scandal-ridden terms as President of the United States, Grant again fell on hard times after involvement in some disastrous business dealings. Suffering from terminal cancer, he hoped to secure his family&#x2019;s financial future &#x2014; at least in part &#x2014; by publishing his memoirs. That remarkable work &#x2014; considered by many authorities among the finest military memoirs ever written &#x2014; is reprinted here, complete and unabridged.<br>Concentrating primarily on Civil War military campaigns, Grant&#x2019;s firsthand accounts of those campaigns offer students and historians an incomparable vantage point on the conflict. There are also excellent observations of the Mexican War and glimpses of Grant&#x2019;s personal life &#x2014; boyhood, the years at West Point, his marriage to Julia Dent, and more. Throughout, Grant displays a calm detachment, generosity, integrity, and intelligence that are deeply moving.<br>The present volume reproduces the unabridged text, lengthy Appendix and all illustrations from the original two-volume edition published in 1885-86. The work is further enhanced by the addition of historic photographs by famed Civil War photographer Mathew Brady and others.<br>In this affordably priced unabridged edition, <i>Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant</i> will be eagerly welcomed by students of American history and the legions of military enthusiasts and Civil War buffs.</p><p>In 1862, a prominent Republican visited President Lincoln and called General Ulysses S. Grant an incompetent drunk who created unnecessary political problems. Lincoln, frustrated with all his generals but this one, famously replied: "I can't spare this man; he fights." Indeed, Lincoln had gone through a series of unheroic generals before settling on Grant to lead the Union's Army of the Potomac. Grant's success at marshaling the industrial might of the North eventually pounded the South into submission. This memoir, finished as its author was dying of throat cancer in 1885, is widely admired for its clear and straightforward prose. The volume was an enormously popular hit upon publication (by Mark Twain, no less), and today <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant</i> ranks among the finest pieces of military autobiography ever written.These are in stock and ready for immediate shipment if you use the DSI4 Marketplace shop.

Though the years since have seen an enormous flowering of research on Darwin and other nineteenth-century scientists concerned with evolution, as well as the larger social and cultural responses to their work, <i>The Darwinian Revolution</i> remains remarkably current and stimulating.<br> <br> For this edition Michael Ruse has written a new afterword that takes into account the research published since his book's first appearance.<br> <br> "It is difficult to believe that yet another book on Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution could add anything new or contain any surprises. Ruse's book is an exception on all counts. Darwin scholars and the general reader alike can learn from it."&#x2014;David L.

But, one life time is not enough to master the fine art of living. Distilled over centuries, the biblical book of Ecclesiastes offers us the time-tested advice of Israel's sages. This is the best of wisdom, with echoes of East and West-from Zen and Tao to Merton and Moore--all rolled into one.<br>In Ecclesiastes, Bible scholar Choon-Leong Seow creatively translates and carefully interprets one of the world's most profound, most enduring collections of ancient wisdom. Sometimes joyful and exultant, other times cynical and fatalistic, the ancient author Qohelet ("Teacher") wrestles with the ups and downs of real life.

He lives in Maryland. <b>The National Security Archive</b> is a nonprofit research library of declassified US government documentation in Washington, DC.For years, the United States government maintained top-secret archives detailing its policy in Chile and its role in aiding and securing General Pinochet's rise to dictatorial power in the early 1970s. In this examination of the thousands of records recently declassified by the CIA, White House, NSC, Pentagon and FBI, Kornbluh offers new revelations about America's development of a policy dedicated to overthrowing Chile's existing democratic government and to replacing it with a military leader reviled for his complete disregard for human rights. Throughout the book, Kornbluh-a director of the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research library-buttresses his assertions with excerpts from the relevant documents, and attempts to shed light on some of the outstanding questions of the period that still beg for answers, including what motivated President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to authorize the bloody campaign and how involved the US government actually was in the September 1973 coup itself. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All Clear 3: Listening and Speaking, 2nd Edition</h2><p>All Clear teaches students to recognize and produce the high-frequency idioms, phrases, and contemporary expressions needed in a range of conversational situations.

Unlike Freud, who utilized neuroses as his working model, Guattari adopted the model of schizophrenia&#x2015;which he believed to be an extreme mental state induced by the capitalist system itself, and one that enforces neurosis as a way of maintaining normality. Guattari's post-Marxist vision of capitalism provides a new definition not only of mental illness, but also of the micropolitical means for its subversion. Chaosophy includes such provocative pieces as &#x201c;Everybody Wants to Be a Fascist,&#x201d; a group of texts on Guattari's collaborative work with Gilles Deleuze (including the appendix to Anti-Oedipus, not available in the English edition), and &#x201c;How Martians Make Love,&#x201d; a roundtable discussion with Guattari, Lotringer, Catherine Cl�ment, and Serge Leclaire from 1972 (still unpublished in French).

She explains how the soul is a form of sacred energy that can escape when someone experiences trauma or is threatened by challenging and stressful situations. Its absence can be responsible for a host of negative conditions including physical ailments, depression, insomnia, and dysfunctional behavior patterns. <br><br>Exploring how to retrieve this sacred energy, or soul fragments, as well as resolve cases of soul theft, the author details how to journey through the non-ordinary realms of the Underworld, Middleworld, and Upperworld to locate lost soul fragments and reintegrate them. She explains how to enter a trance journey, providing instructions for shamanic breathwork practices, shamanic dancing, sounding and toning methods, as well as hand postures (mudras) to facilitate trance states. She explores how to perform soul diagnosis, create a loving and nurturing space for soul fragments to return, and work with the healing wisdom of the 5 Mesoamerican cardinal directions: South, West, North, East, and the Center, which marries the other directions and offers a portal to other worlds. She offers pressure point exercises to release the energies of traumas and contemplative exercises to continue the reintegration of soul fragments after the trance journey. She also explains how to connect with animal guardians to aid you in the soul retrieval process. <br><br>Revealing how to achieve a lasting retrieval of soul energy, Buenaflor shows how the dynamic process of curanderismo soul retrieval can heal many forms and degrees of trauma and help people move forward in life with more clarity, self-awareness, empowerment, and greater depths of authentic self-love.</p><p>Erika Buenaflor, M.A., J.D., has a master&#x2019;s degree in religious studies with a focus on Mesoamerican shamanism from the University of California at Riverside.

But dedicated devotion to our spiritual development, healing, and awareness always tempers and can overcome any difficulties and excesses. Many of the ancient Mesoamerican associations with the South still hold for soul retrieval work, but now we will be applying these understandings to help us with our particular modern Western issues. <br><br>The South is both the path to and serves as our internal Underworld. It is where we go from within to discover, understand, and heal lost soul pieces, the cause(s) of our lost soul pieces, when the losses happened and why, shadow aspects, undisciplined excesses, and neglected and unloved aspects of ourselves. It is also the space where we begin to comprehend what we need to learn and integrate and how we can truly honor our lost soul pieces and move forward. Moving forward on this path of healing, introspection, and self-awareness can eventually serve as our own resurrection and rebirth, wherein we create a loving and healthy space for our soul piece(s) to come home to. <br><br>In the soul retrieval process, the principal sacred essence energy that the South has to offer is a fruitful path of personal discovery, self-awareness, and understanding. <br><br>To obtain the greatest benefits in working with the South, it is important to comprehend that the South, or any of the other cardinal spaces, is not simply defined by or limited to the time and space we allot for trance journeying to their realm. If we allow it to be, the wisdom and medicine of the cardinal spaces, in this case the South, can intersect into our seemingly mundane world, and bring synchronicities into our lives that will allow us to further understand the questions we have posed that are integrated into our energetic subtle bodies. This will allow more of our soul pieces to return. Each time a soul piece comes back, we get more energy to persevere and create ideal realities for ourselves. <br><br><b>Journeying into the South <br><br></b>Before journeying into the South choose and create a space you feel comfortable in, and cleanse it. Cleansing spaces generally allows for deeper journeys. One easy way to cleanse your space is to place some copal on a charcoal burner. The copal cleanses spaces, and acts as an offering to the spirits of the South. Begin the journey by thanking the wise Teachers of the South for welcoming you into their sacred space and helping you discover and understand whatever is necessary for the journey. <br><br><b><i>Going into Trance <br></i></b><br>Start by inducing a slight trance state. You can engage in any of the suggested ways to go into a trance state: shamanic breathwork, shamanic dancing, drumming, rattling, or using sound frequencies. If you can induce a trance state quite readily, the tools may not be needed. Nonetheless, you may choose to incorporate them with the understanding that these tools encompass your own personal sacred soul retrieval ceremony. It is your journey so create it in a way that complements your life and preferences. <br><br>This shamanic breathwork exercise is ideal to slow down brain wave activity and enter into a deep trance state, and of course, drumming, or any of the other shamanic tools also work. The Mudra is <i>Chok</i> (to sprinkle). <br><br>For Chok, the index, middle, ring, and pinky are together and slightly curled in, both hands are in chok mudra. <br><br>The right hand is above the head with the arm gently extended up, elbow slightly bent, and the left hand is between your navel and sternum. <br><br>With a slow inhale switch the position of the hands, so the left hand is now above the head with the arm gently extended up elbow slightly bent, and the right hand is between your navel and sternum. <br><br>When the hands have switched positions, take 3 sharp breaths out the mouth contracting the abdomen while doing so. <br><br>Repeat this for at least 3 minutes. <br><br>Thereafter, take 7 slow inhales and exhales in and out from the nose, feeling the heartbeat slow down as you inhale and exhale. <br><br><i>Journeying in the South <br></i><br>Once you have achieved a trance state, set the intention to journey into the South. When your consciousness navigates you into the South, you can call upon your power animals or other guides to take you to your lost soul piece or you can simply permit yourself to search for this lost soul piece. The whole time you are in this space notice your surroundings, and take note if you can tell which non-ordinary realm you are in. <br><br>Once you sense, feel, hear, see, and/or know that you have come across the lost soul piece, observe it with whatever sense(s) are the most predominant. See if you recognize it, and sense whether the energy is you in this lifetime or another lifetime. Let it know that you have come to discover and understand why it left. Allow a light of love to radiate out from your sacred heart and connect to the soul piece. Through that love-light connect to it, and proceed with the discovery. You can ask it questions, such as: <br><br>� When did you leave me? <br>� Why did you feel you have to go? <br>� What do you have to teach me? <br>� What do you and I need to be healed? <br>� How can I honor you? <br>� How can I look after you? <br>� How can I help you feel safe? <br>� How can I love you? <br>� What, if anything, can I do to create a space within me that you want to come home to? <br>� Are you ready to come home into our sacred heart?</p><h2>Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz</h2><p>This is a unique, eye-witness account of everyday life right at the heart of the Nazi extermination machine. <p>Slomo Venezia was born into a poor Jewish-Italian community living in Thessaloniki, Greece. At first, the occupying Italians protected his family; but when the Germans invaded, the Venezias were deported to Auschwitz. His mother and sisters disappeared on arrival, and he learned, at first with disbelief, that they had almost certainly been gassed. Given the chance to earn a little extra bread, he agreed to become a &#x2018;Sonderkommando', without realising what this entailed. He soon found himself a member of the &#x2018;special unit' responsible for removing the corpses from the gas chambers and burning their bodies.</p> <p>Dispassionately, he details the grim round of daily tasks, evokes the terror inspired by the man in charge of the crematoria, &#x2018;Angel of Death' Otto Moll, and recounts the attempts made by some of the prisoners to escape, including the revolt of October 1944.</p> <p>It is usual to imagine that none of those who went into the gas chambers at Auschwitz ever emerged to tell their tale - but, as a member of a &#x2018;Sonderkommando', Shlomo Venezia was given this horrific privilege. He knew that, having witnessed the unspeakable, he in turn would probably be eliminated by the SS in case he ever told his tale. He survived: this is his story.</p> <p><br> Published in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p></p><p><b>Shlomo Venezia </b>was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz."'A unique participant's account of everyday death and life,' the jacket says. That sense of existential inversion is what comes across most strongly in this book, more strongly than even Levi's greatest work can convey."<br> <b><i>The Australian</i></b> <p>"Venezia reports soberly and seemingly without emotion - and yet the book becomes breathtaking in its forcefulness."<br><i><b>Holocaust and Genocide Studies</b></i></p> <p>"Venezia's experiences during the war is at once both fascinating and disturbing. His description of prewar Salonika and his complicated ethnic/national background certainly help illuminate our picture of the multicultural societies of Europe that the Second World War nearly completely eliminated. He also captures the violence and brutality of Auschwitz in a very readable fashion. His descriptions of the inhumanity of the camp will remain with me for quite some time."<br><i><b>H-Net: Humanities and Social Science Reviews Online</b></i></p> <p>"A deeply sincere, unadorned description of Venezia's journey through hell ... There are few, if any, better descriptions of the impact of massive psychic trauma on the human soul." <br> <b><i>Jewish Book World</i></b></p> <p>"Venezia comes across as a very reliable witness. His language is clear, and he certainly does not idealize the members of the 'Sonderkommando' or his own role in the extermination process. It is a detailed and heartbreaking story, told in very restrained language."<br><i><b>Journal of Contemporary History</b></i></p> <p>"A harrowingly matter-of-fact account."<br><i><b>Boston Globe</b></i><br><br>"Most Sonderkommando members were systematically killed by the SS. But fate allowed Shlomo Venezia to survive, and the horrific privilege to bear witness."<br><i><b>History Wire</b></i></p> <p>"Shlomo Venezia's unnervingly dispassionate personal record demands to be heard. Interviewer Beatrice Prasquier's brusque questions, answered with painful truthfulness, bring home the lifelong scars this Greek Italian Jew must carry from the ever-present memories of the numberless innocents he helped lead to their grotesque slaughter." <br> <b><i>Morning Star</i></b></p> <p>"What is remarkable is on the one hand the lack of anger, the simple language dealing with events that are unforgettable and beyond reality, and on the other hand the fact of Venezia's daily life ever since ... He has never, in his mind, lived outside the camp." <br> <b><i>Atsmi Uvsari</i></b></p> <p>"I read many accounts of former deportees, and each time they take me back to life in the camp. But the story told by Shlomo Venezia is especially overwhelming because it is the only complete eye-witness account that we have from a survivor of the Sonderkommandos."<br> <b>Simone Veil</b></p> <p>"This holocaust survivor's testimony, like all others, will be read with fear and trembling."<br> <b>Elie Wiesel, Nobel Laureate</b></p></p><h2>PHYSICAL SCIENCE TEACHERS EDITION (Ags Physical Science)</h2><p>Physical Science Teacher&#39;s Edition</p><p></p><h2>Sin-a-Rama: Expanded Edition: Sleaze Sex Paperbacks of the Sixties</h2><p><p>"In this entertaining and still-stimulating collection, the ways in which the various authors dealt with their work emerge with radical variety, just as different individuals treat their more basic instincts." &#x2014;David Cotner, <i>LA Weekly</i></p><p>Contributions by Stephen J.

To its author, H. G. Wells, the novel was as compelling as &#x201c;a good gripping dream.&#x201d; But to generations of readers, the terrible and evil experiment of the demented scientist, Griffin, has conveyed a chilling nightmare of believable horror. An atmosphere of ever-increasing suspense begins with the arrival of a mysterious stranger at an English village inn and builds relentlessly to the stark terror of a victim pursued by a maniacal invisible man. The result is a masterwork: a dazzling display of the brilliant imagination, psychological insight, and literary craftsmanship that made H. G. Wells one of the most influential writers of his time.</p><p>This work is part of &#34;The Annotated H.G.

Gruwell lives in Long Beach.<b>INTRODUCTION<br></b><br><i>The Freedom Writers Diary Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i> takes students through a three-stage process that will maximize their understanding of <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> while supporting the central message of tolerance. For best results, I suggest that you begin teaching the Engage Your Students activities first, following the order presented&#x2013;which mirrors the timeline in <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>. The activities in Enlighten Your Students and Empower Your Students can then be taught according to what best suits your individual curricular needs and weekly schedules. There are no specific time allotments designated for the activities presented in this <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i>. Teachers can implement activities in one class period or over multiple days.<br><br><b><br>The Engage, Enlighten, and Empower Model<br></b><br><b>Engage Your Students:</b> This section includes lesson plans and activities for you to share with your students before they begin reading <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>. The goal is to establish a collaborative and supportive academic environment that will draw your students into the learning process, help them make connections between who they are as individuals and who they are as students, and encourage them to discover commonalities with their classmates.<br><b><br>Enlighten Your Students:</b> This section offers lesson plans and activities that help students delve into literary themes, topics, and concepts while reading <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>, and concludes with a unit on the film, <i>Freedom Writers</i> (2007). Due to its range of contents, Enlighten Your Students covers various categories for ease of use: writing, vocabulary, grammar, oral communication, culminating activities, and <i>Freedom Writers</i> film activities. Students will practice different kinds of writing and public speaking, and become critical thinkers as they explore their own opinions, reasoning, and reactions within a &#x201c;real world&#x201d; context.<br><br><b>Empower Your Students:</b> This section encourages students to achieve positive changes in themselves and in their communities by bringing the outside world into the classroom, and taking their classroom into the world. Nontraditional activities, such as inviting a guest speaker into class or taking a field trip, can expose students to new social and academic perspectives.<br><br><i>The Teachers Guide</i> promotes a holistic approach to language arts: We integrate reading, writing, vocabulary, and grammar with a variety of learning modalities, all focused on a common theme. Each lesson plan for the Engage, Enlighten, and Empower sections of the book contains five important educational elements: implementing different learning modalities, the use of visual graphics, journal writing, adherence to academic standards, and authentic assessment. What follows are brief introductions to each of these elements.<br><b>Learning Modalities<br></b><br>Many of the Freedom Writers struggled with learning disabilities (dyslexia) or behavioral challenges (Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). In addition, some were English Language Learners. As a new teacher, I desperately tried a variety of ways to engage my students and bring my activities to life.<br><br>Little did I know that my wacky idea of bringing in two sandwiches and some clumsy drawings of sandwich ingredients to teach about writing would prove successful. Later, I found out why this technique worked. Dr. Howard Gardner, a Harvard professor, advanced the theory of multiple intelligences to illustrate that all human beings have a repertoire of skills for solving different problems; within these repertoires, however, individuals have different learning modalities. By bringing in sandwiches, sketches, and other elements to teach the writing process, I managed to activate my students&#x2019; linguistic, visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal learning modalities. (*)<br><br>Following suit, your students will have opportunities to use different learning modalities as they move from activity to activity. Each lesson plan includes a list of materials that you will need, ranging from popular culture (music and movie clips), to food items (peanuts and Froot Loops), to art supplies (crayons and poster boards). Be sure to check ahead of time what you will need for each activity. We also suggest that you have a television and DVD player, a CD player, and a computer.<br><b>Visual Graphics<br><br></b>I found that traditional note taking was often a significant challenge for the <i>Freedom Writers</i>. Allowing my students to process information and demonstrate their comprehension through visual techniques greatly enhanced the learning process. I am not artistic by any means, but I found that admitting my lack of talent seemed to bolster my students&#x2019; sense of artist confidence. Suddenly, my creative students were tempted to submit their own visual graphics.<br><br>We have included student-drawn visual graphics with each activity in this guide, as well as explanations for how to use them. Your students may think these visual graphics are corny, so play off their reaction and challenge them to do better! Your students can create their own visual graphics for an activity using a black marker and blank sheet of paper. Add their names along with a copyright symbol at the bottom of the original, photocopy,<br>and distribute to the class. Have contributors come to class early and draw their images on the board so that you can use the new graphic while modeling the activity for the class.<br><b>Journal Writing<br></b><br>To mirror the Freedom Writer experience, we recommend that you provide journals for your students prior to reading <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>.<br>By keeping journals, students learn to value writing as a process. Journal writing is an avenue through which your students can respond to events in their personal lives and in their academic lives. Because all the students will keep journals at the same time, they bond as a community of writers, reflecting on their individual and shared experiences at school, at home, and in their neighborhoods.<br><br>The license to write freely, without fear of criticism or judgment, is central to the success of student journals. The Freedom Writers method allows students to voice their own truths, however painful or awkward, in honest, unvarnished prose. Too often, I believe, writing is rewarded merely on the basis of standard spelling, punctuation, and usage. Teachers should also value vivid, forceful student writing that actually says something.<br>Encouraging students to use their own voices unleashes their potential for powerful self-expression and deeply effective storytelling.<br><br>The <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i> also includes activities that require students to use different writing styles in different contexts for different audiences. As students learn to edit their own and each other&#x2019;s prose for a specific purpose, they develop skills essential to success in the classroom and beyond. Since many educators have used <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> as a launching pad to discuss specific themes and inspired journal writing in their classrooms, we have provided writing prompts for every diary entry in Appendix B.<br><b>Academic Standards<br></b><br><i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> can easily be taught as literature on its own. However, using this <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i> will help you fulfill the requirements established by English Language Arts national standards. The current trend in education is for all curricula to be standards-based. As teachers, we must abide by the standards that our state and districts have adopted to ensure that our students are meeting their achievement goals in each academic area. We have aligned each activity in this guide with the Language Arts standards formulated by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE). Standards can be daunting, something imposed from the outside. However, the language of the NCTE standards does a good job of emphasizing the learner at the center of the academic process.<br><br>I understand that most states have their own specific standards, but there are also many commonalities that you will find reflected in the criteria listed in Appendix C. It is these common and interrelated themes that we address and that are specified in greater detail on the Web site for the National Council of Teachers of English: www.ncte.org.<br><b>Authentic Assessment<br></b><br>Standardized tests are a reality of our educational system. Regardless of how teachers may personally feel about the effectiveness of such testing programs, there is no way around them. But it does not follow that teaching to the test is the best way to educate our students, or even to help them achieve top scores. I believe that the best teaching and the best learning happen when you teach to a student, not to a test.<br><br>This <i>Teachers Guide</i> does not include quizzes, multiple-choice tests, or standardized essays. Instead, every activity is organized around the idea of authentic assessment. In authentic assessment, students are asked to demonstrate their language arts skills through meaningful and relevant tasks; teachers, meanwhile, monitor the strengths and needs of their students as they progress from activity to activity.<br><br>The <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i> employs multiple forms of authentic assessment:<br><br>� <b>Visual graphics:</b> The graphics associated with each activity provide an immediate way of measuring the level of student engagement.<br><br>�<b> Open-ended questions:</b> Activities include open-ended language exercises that allow students to employ imagination, creativity, and critical thinking skills.<br><br>� <b>Language arts assessment:</b> A range of writing assignments, including interviews, letter writing, and a feature story, provide opportunities for evaluating student progress in reading and writing.<br><br>� <b>Portfolios:</b> We suggest that all assignments be collected in portfolios as a way of tracking students&#x2019; developmental progress and showcasing students&#x2019; work at the end of the unit. Portfolios welcome multiple audiences, including the student, classmates, teachers, and even parents. (We recommend that students use a three-ring binder to organize their portfolio.)<br><br>� <b>Self-evaluation:</b> An integral component of authentic assessment is self-evaluation, giving students an opportunity to review their academic progress.<br><br>It is my firm belief that authentic assessment does not compete with, but rather enhances student performance on mandated tests. By honoring their reading, writing, and communication skills through meaningful activities in which they are fully engaged, students develop critical thinking skills that serve them in testing environments and in the world at large.<br><b>Now It's Your Turn<br></b><br>Within the engaging, enlightening, and empowering lesson plans in the <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i>, you will find the key ingredients for cooking up success in your own classroom. We want to emphasize that <i>The Freedom Writers Diary </i>and the accompanying <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i> are not intended to serve as a substitute for your mandated curriculum, but rather as a means of enhancing that curriculum and encouraging your students to perform at the highest level. There is no one perfect model for every classroom, so we look to you as independent educators to implement our lesson plans as you see fit.<br><br>As a teacher, I was inspired by my students&#x2019; hearts, minds, and voices, which reverberate within the pages of <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>. In that spirit, I have tried to honor the hearts, minds, and voices of your students as they read <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> and engage in the activities contained in this <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Guide</i>.<br><b>Mandated Reporting<br></b><br>You must make your students aware of the fact that teachers are &#x201c;mandated reporters&#x201d; and therefore obligated by law to report cases of child abuse or neglect when and if they become aware of such instances through their students&#x2019; communications (oral or written). This does not mean students are prohibited from such communications, only that they must be made aware of possible repercussions.<br>***<br><br><b>ENGAGE YOUR STUDENTS<br></b><br>The Engage Your Students lesson plans allow students to forge new friendships, create a community, and establish the foundation for a nurturing and collaborative learning environment before they begin reading <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>. Most students, especially those in their teens, tend to be reluctant to share their anxieties and vulnerabilities. These activities challenge students to get out of their comfort zones and utilize all of their learning modalities. In doing so, a wealth of information about your students is revealed. This information will enable you to tap into your students&#x2019; experiences, sensibilities, and learning styles as a starting point for their explorations of literature and language. I highly recommend that you teach the lessons in the order presented: first you engage your students as individuals, then as partners with other students, next as collaborative groups, and finally as a cohesive community within the classroom. <br><br>� <b>Visual Graphics:</b> Each activity has an original visual graphic designed to promote student participation while enhancing the particular theme of the lesson. For best results, have students clear everything off their desks except for the visual graphic and other materials integral to the activity. While students write or draw on their graphics, you will have an opportunity to walk around the room and assess their level of engagement and understanding. <br><br>� <b>Vocabulary:</b> Each activity contains vocabulary words that were inspired by the specific activity. The words are brought together at the end of the section in a culminating activity called Freedom Writer Bingo. These words will familiarize your students with concepts and terms useful for reading <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i>.<br><br>� <b>Journal Writing:</b> After the inaugural <i>What Makes Me Unique</i> assignment, the journal writing prompts in this section are listed under the Assessments that conclude each activity. Journals serve as a way for students to reflect and expand upon their increasing awareness of themselves and their classmates. At the same time, teachers can use the journals to evaluate how much understanding and insight their students glean from each activity. Encourage your students to write in their journals every day about their experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This out-of-class &#x201c;free writing&#x201d; may yield some of your students&#x2019; best stories, which they can then revise for the Class Book, the culminating project for the Enlighten Your Students section.<br><br>� <b><i>Primetime Live</i></b> <b>DVD</b>: Although this activity is optional, I have learned that teachers who use this video with their students have found it to be an exceptional motivational tool. (To order this DVD, please visit www.freedomwritersfoundation.org or www.films.com.)<br>***<br><br><b>LESSON PLAN FORMAT<br></b><br>The lesson plans for the Engage Your Students section of the <i>Teacher&#x2019;s Gui</i>de are presented in a consistent format for ease of implementation. Each contains the following components: <br><br>� <b>Objective:</b> Describes the overall goal of the activity.<br>� <b>Backstory from Room 203:</b> Provides context, background, and pedagogical reasoning behind the activity derived from my classroom.<br>� <b>Ms. G&#x2019;s Tips:</b> Provides anecdotal advice from my personal experience.<br>� <b>What You&#x2019;ll Need:</b> List of required materials.<br>� <b>Process:</b> Step-by-step explanation of how to do each activity.<br>� <b>Visual Graphic Instructions:</b> Brief summary of how to u...</p><h2>Michael Kohlhaas</h2><p><p><strong>An extraordinary masterpiece of German literature, now in a gripping new English translation &nbsp;</strong></p> Michael Kohlhaas has been wronged. First his finest horses were unfairly confiscated and mistreated. And things keep going worse&#x2015;his servants have been beaten, his wife killed, and the lawsuits he pursues are stymied&#x2015;but Kohlhaas, determined to find justice at all costs, tirelessly persists. Standing up against the bureaucratic machine of the empire, Kohlhaas becomes an indomitable figure that you can&#x2019;t help rooting for from start to finish. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knotty, darkly comical, magnificent in its weirdness, and one of the greatest and most influential tales in German literature, this short novel, first published in German in 1810, is now available in award-winning Michael Hofmann&#x2019;s sparkling new English translation.</p></p><p><p>Heinrich von Kleist (1777&#x2013;1811) was a German poet, dramatist, novelist, short-story writer, and journalist, who committed double suicide with a terminally ill friend.</p><p>The poet Michael Hofmann has won numerous prizes for his German translations.</p>&#x201c;His sentences are remarkable&#x2015;great hatchet-blows of thought, an implacable narrative speed, a pulverizing sense of inevitability. No wonder Kafka liked him so much...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Auster</strong><br><br>&#x201c;What revolted the mature Goethe in the young Kleist, who submitted his works to the elder statesman &#x2018;on the knees of his heart&#x2019;&#x2015;the morbid, the hysterical, the sense of the unhealthy, the enormous indulgence in suffering out of which Kleist&#x2019;s plays and tales were mined&#x2015;is just what we value today. Today Kleist gives pleasure, most of Goethe is a classroom bore.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Susan Sontag</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps the strongest of all German stories.&nbsp;Michael Kohlhaas&nbsp;seems to me to have a peculiar resonance to the present time, when apathy toward the law, callousness toward injustice, a limp acceptance of "the way things are" exercise a paralyzing influence all over the world. Kleist shows us, incidentally, with a superb, mordant humor, the predicament into which a society accustomed to constant abuse of the law is thrown by a man who refuses to put up with such abuse; how his associates gradually withdraw from the doltish robber baron who created the whole mess&#x2015;with whom they would have continued to get along easily had it not been for the unpleasant consequences of his insolent act... We are filled with anxiety and terror, shudder in the face of mystery, doubt in the powers of reason, and, indeed, in the power of God himself&#x2015;all our 'affects are confounded.' Kleist knows how to put us on the rack and&#x2015;such is his triumph as an artist&#x2015;succeeds in making us thank him for that torture.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas Mann</strong><br><br>&#x201c;I did not write to you last night, it got too late because of Michael Kohlhaas (have you read it? If not, don&#x2019;t! I shall read it to you!); apart from a short section which I had read the day before, I finished it in one sitting. Probably for the tenth time. This is a story I read with true piety; it carries me along waves of wonder.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Franz Kafka</strong></p><h2>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (Mythos Books)</h2><p><p>Jane Harrison examines the festivals of ancient Greek religion to identify the primitive "substratum" of ritual and its persistence in the realm of classical religious observance and literature. In Harrison's preface to this remarkable book, she writes that J. G. Frazer's work had become part and parcel of her "mental furniture" and that of others studying primitive religion. Today, those who write on ancient myth or ritual are bound to say the same about Harrison. Her essential ideas, best developed and most clearly put in the Prolegomena, have never been eclipsed.</p></p><p>Jane Ellen Harrison (1850-1928) was a pioneer in the academic study of myth. Using the then emerging disciplines of anthropology and ethnology, she demonstrates in this book (from 1903) that the mythological tales of the Greeks embody systems of belief which are widespread among societies both &#39;primitive&#39; and &#39;advanced&#39;.<p>"Harrison's <i>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion</i> is a book that breathes life. It is an exciting, deeply felt intellectual quest, with a broad view of the role of religion in life, ancient and modern. Harrison is not afraid to look for relevance in archaic cult, and doesn't flinch on finding it. From a study of Greek anthropomorphism, she can conclude, like a seeress looking beyond the early twentieth century: 'to be human is not necessarily to be humane.'"<b>--Richard Martin, Princeton University</b></p></p><h2>Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics: for Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach, Eighth Edition</h2><p><p><strong>A supplemental book of problems and exercises keyed to the text.</strong></p></p><p>Hal R. Varian is the chief economist at Google.</p><h2>Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II</h2><p><p>Was Franco sympathetic to Nazi Germany? Why didn't Spain enter World War II? In what ways did Spain collaborate with the Third Reich? How much did Spain assist Jewish refugees?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first book in any language to answer these intriguing questions. Stanley Payne, a leading historian of modern Spain, explores the full range of Franco&#x2019;s relationship with Hitler, from 1936 to the fall of the Reich in 1945. But as Payne brilliantly shows, relations between these two dictators were not only a matter of <i>realpolitik</i>.&nbsp; These two titanic egos engaged in an extraordinary tragicomic drama often verging on the dark absurdity of a Beckett or Ionesco play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas Payne investigates the evolving relationship of the two regimes up to the conclusion of World War II, his principal concern is the enigma of Spain&#x2019;s unique position during the war, as a semi-fascist country struggling to maintain a tortured neutrality. Why Spain did not enter the war as a German ally, joining with Hitler to seize Gibraltar and close the Mediterranean to the British navy, is at the center of Payne&#x2019;s narrative. Franco&#x2019;s only personal meeting with Hitler, in 1940 to discuss precisely this, is recounted here in groundbreaking detail that also sheds significant new light on the Spanish government&#x2019;s vacillating policy toward Jewish refugees, on the Holocaust, and on Spain&#x2019;s German connection throughout the duration of the war.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Stanley G. Payne is Hilldale-Jaume Vicens Vives Professor of History Emeritus, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison. He is a world authority on the history of European fascism and is the author of many books on Spanish and modern European history, including <i>The Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union, and Communism</i> and <i>The Collapse of the Spanish Republic, 1933&#x2013;1936</i>, both published by Yale University Press. He lives in Madison, WI.</p>&#x201c;Stanley Payne is recognized as the most serious and informed foreign historian of modern Spain in a whole range of areas. Here he deals with a subject of considerable debate and makes a major contribution to European and Spanish history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Juan Linz, Yale University&nbsp;<br> (Juan Linz)<br><br>"Stanley Payne has written an excellent study of the relations between Franco and his regime and the Germans during the years of the civil and world wars.

Doctors loathed this time-consuming procedure and for centuries relied on midwives. Later, they substituted the efficiency of mechanical devices, including the electric vibrator, invented in the 1880s. In The Technology of Orgasm, Rachel Maines offers readers a stimulating, surprising, and often humorous account of hysteria and its treatment throughout the ages, focusing on the development, use, and fall into disrepute of the vibrator as a legitimate medical device.</p></p><p>For centuries, women diagnosed with "hysteria"--a "disease paradigm," in Rachel P. Maines's felicitous phrase, thought to result from a lack of sexual intercourse or gratification--were treated by massaging their genitals in order to induce "paroxysm." Male physicians, however, considered the practice drudgery, and sought various ways of avoiding the task, often foisting it off on midwives or, starting in the late 19th century, employing mechanical devices. Eventually, these devices became available for purchase and home use; one such "portable vibrator" is advertised in the 1918 Sears, Roebuck catalog as an "aid that every woman appreciates." <i>The Technology of Orgasm</i> is an impeccably researched history that combines a discussion of hysteria in the Western medical tradition with a detailed examination (including several illustrations) of the devices used to "treat" the "condition." (Maines is somewhat dismissive of the contemporary, phallus-shaped models, which she describes as "underpowered battery-operated toys," insisting that "it is the AC-powered vibrator with at least one working surface at a right angle to the handle that is best designed for application to the clitoral area.") Don't expect any cheap thrills, though; the titillation Maines offers is strictly intellectual. <i>--Ron Hogan</i><p>Rachel P.

The result is better product quality and greater participation by workers in efforts to improve your processes, your products, and your company as a whole.<p>The first section of the book uses a simple, illustrated format to summarize many of the concepts and main features of poka-yoke. The second section shows 240 examples of poka-yoke improvements implemented in Japanese plants.</p><p>The book:</p><ul><li> Organizes examples according to the broad issue or problem they address.</li><li> Pinpoints how poka-yoke applies to specific devices, parts and products, categories of improvement methods, and processes.</li><li> Provides sample improvement forms for you to sketch out your own ideas.</li></ul><p>Use Poka-yoke in study groups as a model for your improvement efforts. It may be your single most important step toward eliminating defects completely. (For an industrial engineering perspective on how source inspection and poka-yoke can work together to reduce defects to zero, see Shigeo Shingo's Zero Quality Control.)</p></p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Barron&#39;s AP Music Theory with MP3 CD, 2nd Edition</h2><p>In-depth preparation for the AP Music Theory exam features:<br><br><li>Two full-length practice tests (both aural and non-aural sections included)</li><li>All questions answered and explained</li><li>Helpful strategies for test-taking success</li><li>In-depth review chapters covering music fundamentals, harmonic organization, harmonic progression, melodic composition and dictation, harmonic dictation, visual score analysis and much more<br><br>An included MP3 CD provides aural skill development prompts for both practice tests' aural sections, as well as material that complements exercises and examples in the subject review chapters.</li></p><p>Nancy Scoggin has taught instrumental music and AP Music Theory in Joshua, Texas for 32 years.

Basic devices are introduced through a two-chapter format that consists of a first chapter dealing with the particular device category and its models, followed by a second chapter dealing with simplified applications that use only resistive components. Prior to examining transistor amplifier circuits, a general development of amplifiers from a block diagram point of view is presented; and, concepts such as gain, input resistance, output resistance, stage loading, and interaction are developed with simple models before students become involved in specific circuit details.

In the funniest, clearest study to date, Benjamin Bergen explains why, and what that tells us about our language and brains.</b><br>Nearly everyone swears-whether it's over a few too many drinks, in reaction to a stubbed toe, or in flagrante delicto. And yet, we sit idly by as words are banned from television and censored in books. We insist that people excise profanity from their vocabularies and we punish children for yelling the very same dirty words that we'll mutter in relief seconds after they fall asleep. Swearing, it seems, is an intimate part of us that we have decided to selectively deny.<br><br>That's a damn shame. Swearing is useful. It can be funny, cathartic, or emotionally arousing. As linguist and cognitive scientist Benjamin K. Bergen shows us, it also opens a new window onto how our brains process language and why languages vary around the world and over time.<br><br>In this groundbreaking yet ebullient romp through the linguistic muck, Bergen answers intriguing questions: How can patients left otherwise speechless after a stroke still shout <i>Goddamn!</i> when they get upset? When did a <i>cock</i> grow to be more than merely a rooster? Why is <i>crap</i> vulgar when <i>poo</i> is just childish? Do slurs make you treat people differently? Why is the first word that Samoan children say not <i>mommy</i> but <i>eat shit</i>? And why do we extend a middle finger to flip someone the bird?<br><br>Smart as hell and funny as fuck, <i>What the F</i> is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to know how and why we swear. <br></p><p><b>Benjamin K.

After all, both authors engaged in a profoundly ambivalent excoriation of their native Ireland. And while O'Brien's sexual politics can make Joyce seem like a fusty Edwardian by comparison, both novelists got a certain amount of flack for their erotic frankness. So this latest match from the Penguin Lives series seems like a good one--and largely lives up to its promise. O'Brien makes no pretense of competing with Richard Ellmann's immense, magisterial portrait. Instead she has concocted in <i>James Joyce</i> something that resembles one of her own novels: a spirited, lyrical, and acerbic narrative that just happens to feature the author of <i>Ulysses</i> in the starring role.<p> Having experienced the constrictions of Irish life firsthand, O'Brien is particularly good on Joyce's downwardly mobile childhood. Was his resulting hatred of his native land exaggerated? Apparently not: </p><blockquote> No one who has not lived in such straitened and hideous circumstances can understand the battering of that upbringing. All the more because they had come down in the world, a tumble from semi-gentility, servants, a nicely laid table, cut glasses, a piano, the accoutrements of middle-class life, relegated to the near slums in Mountjoy Square, the gaunt spectral mansions in which children sat like mice in the gaping doorways. </blockquote> The author also gives a vivid sense of her subject's devotion to his art, an altar upon which he happily sacrificed his family, health, friends, and even his eyesight. She is stubborn in her defense of Joyce's sublime irresponsibility, which she ascribes to all writers: "It is a paradox that while wrestling with the language to capture the human condition they become more callous, and cut off from the very human traits which they so glisteningly depict." O'Brien's own wrestling match in <i>James Joyce</i> has, to be honest, its share of pins and minor pratfalls: there are some embarrassing repetitions and punctuational oddities, and her occasional assimilation of Joyce's own language is an awkward (if heartfelt) form of homage. Still, when she sticks to her own inflections, her account of this "funnominal man" is an eminently readable and entertaining dose of Irish bitters. <i>--James Marcus</i>Edna O'Brien is the author of eighteen books, including <i>The Country Girls' Trilogy</i>, <i>A Fanatic Heart</i>, <i>House of Splendid Isolation</i>, <i>Down by the River</i>, and <i>The High Road</i> (Plume).

Following the recommendations of the ASME Committee on Heat Transfer Education, Kreith/Manglik&#39;s PRINCIPLES OF HEAT TRANSFER, 8E provides a comprehensive engineering approach that is ideal for your study of heat transfer. This relevant book recognizes that in today&#39;s world, computational analysis is more critical than rote mathematical solutions to heat transfer problems. However, the authors also incorporate an effective analytic approach that offers a clear understanding of the physics involved and equips you with the tools for analyzing more complex problems. The book emphasizes applications to current engineering challenges in renewable energy, bioengineering, microelectronics, materials processing, and space exploration to arm you with the practical knowledge you need for success.</p><p>Dr. Frank Kreith was Professor Emeritus in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Science from the University of Paris in 1965. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), a Fellow and Honorary Member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and recipient of the ASME Medal. His areas of interest included heat transfer, thermal engineering, and solar engineering. He was a consultant in the field of heat transfer engineering in many parts of the world. The ASME International established "The Frank Kreith Energy Award" in 2005 in recognition of his contributions to the field of renewable energy and heat transfer.<br><br>Dr. Raj. M. Manglik is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio.

He has received many honors and recognitions for seminal research, teaching and educational enterprise, and professional engineering service. His areas of interest are enhancement of heat transfer, interfacial and transport phenomena, and thermal science and energy engineering. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Enhanced Heat Transfer."The organization is excellent as is, and follows very naturally...The subject matter is complicated but it is presented very well for the students to understand...The material follows very logically, and the organization is great...Knowing the impatience of Engineering students, I find that this material is by no means 'dry.' It is sufficiently spiked and spiced with Engineering examples so that a good Professor can easily use it to present the subject without the entire class getting bored."<br><br>"Authors' approach as outlined in the preface is excellent. Having a summary of new concepts at the beginning of the chapter is helpful to the students. The authors present many examples of practical systems and show how such systems can be analyzed by appropriate engineering models. They have shown students how to go from a practical system to a simplified engineering model to application of heat transfer principles to analyze the model very well. All the problems and examples in this book deal with real-life engineering systems. Many problems deals with topics of current interest (for example, renewable energy)... the material is very well presented and ample examples are provided that students can relate to."</p><h2>Positive Discipline: The First Three Years, Revised and Updated Edition: From Infant to Toddler--Laying the Foundation for Raising a Capable, Confident</h2><p>The celebrated Positive Discipline brand of parenting books presents the revised and updated third edition of their readable and practical guide to communicating boundaries to very young children and solving early discipline problems to set children up for success.<br><br>Over the years millions of parents have used the amazingly effective strategies of Positive Discipline to raise happy, well-behaved, and successful children. Research has shown that the first three years in a child's life are a critical moment in their development, and that behavior patterns instilled during that time can have profound implications for the rest of a child's life. Hundreds of thousands of parents have already used the advice in Positive Discipline: The First Three Years to help set effective boundaries, forge strong foundations for healthy communication, and lay the groundwork for happy and respectful relationships with their young children. Now this classic title has been revised and updated to reflect the latest neuroscientific research and developments in positive discipline parenting techniques.</p><p>JANE NELSON, Ed.D., coauthor of the bestselling Positive Discipline series, is a licensed marriage, family, and child therapist and an internationally known speaker.

A new parent may be shocked by the news that a baby is on the way, or thrilled that the days of pregnancy tests and &#x201c;trying&#x201d; are finally over. Either way, there is no ignoring this �life-�changing bit of news. Your life as an independent, spontaneous person will change: Baby is on the way.<br><br>Most adults find that adding an infant to the family, no matter how anticipated and dearly loved that infant may be, brings changes that take some getting used to. Adult relationships must flex and adapt, making room for the new addition. Schedules and priorities change, as does Mom&#x2019;s body. Babies can be perplexing little people, operating by rules known only to �them&#x2014;�and each comes with his own unique set of rules. Some parents are blessed with an &#x201c;easy&#x201d; first baby, and are then shocked and mystified when their second baby is not so easy. Others begin with a &#x201c;challenging&#x201d; baby, and are pleasantly surprised when their second baby is &#x201c;easier.&#x201d;<br><br>The first few months of your new �baby&#x2019;s life may be exhausting, exhilarating, and challenging, all at once. It may be hard to believe, but one day you will look back at these demanding days and sleepless nights with nostalgia and realize your child grew up much too fast. But for now, those musings lie far in the future.<br><br>Setting the Stage for Baby<br><br>Close your eyes for just a moment and think back to the first time you saw your newborn&#x2019;s face. She may have been red, bald, and wrinkled, but chances are you felt you&#x2019;d never seen anything more beautiful, or heard anything sweeter than her first cries. Writers and painters have tried to capture the magic of those first moments of life, but words and pictures are rarely powerful enough to convey what happens between parent and child.<br><br>For most parents, the months leading up to that miraculous moment of birth are filled with plans, dreams, and a few worries. In reflective moments, you probably wondered whether you would be a good parent, whether you&#x2019;d know what to do, whether the baby would be &#x201c;all right.&#x201d; Expectant parents talk endlessly about the relative merits of cloth and disposable diapers, of nursing and formula feeding, of �store-�bought and homemade baby food. They discuss names for hours, saying them aloud to see how they fit.<br><br>New parents buy and are given impossibly tiny garments and mysterious articles with odd names like &#x201c;receiving blanket.&#x201d; They wonder if they&#x2019;ll somehow know what to do with them (both the babies and the blankets) when the time comes. They purchase and ponder over the fascinating gadgetry of babyhood: car seats, carriers, cribs, pacifiers, bottles, breast pumps, and monitors. The grandparents &#x201c;tsk, tsk&#x201d; as they point out that millions of children were raised without all these fancy gadgets, or they rush out to buy even more dazzling ones. In this age of consumerism, with so many adorable clothes and such tempting equipment available, who can possibly resist? This is a time for endless dreaming, a time for hope and wonder.<br><br>Fantasy Versus Reality<br><br>Sometimes, though, when you carry that helpless little bundle of humanity home from the hospital, the dreams fade a bit in the harsh light of reality. The baby cries, sometimes for hours, and it&#x2019;s up to you to figure out why. Or the little darling sleeps all day then gurgles happily all night, much to the dismay of his �sleep-�deprived parents. Babies seem to be born with a detector that lets them know when Mom wants to eat, so they can interrupt with a need of their own. The baby spits up when you&#x2019;re dressed to go out, may have several bowel movements in a single night, and sometimes cries angrily when handed to eager relatives.<br><br>From those first moments, parenting young children can become an avalanche of questions, anxieties, and frustrations, as well as an incredible source of love and joy. As that precious baby grows, develops, and changes, life can become a seemingly endless stream of challenging decisions and new ideas to be tested.<br><br>As your child grows, people in public places may smile knowingly or talk about the &#x201c;terrible twos.&#x201d; Many parents feel completely at the mercy of the adorable little tyrant their baby or toddler has become, while others seem confident and at ease handling meltdowns or constant interruptions.<br><br>How Will I Know What to Do?<br><br>Most of us learn parenting skills from our parents or by trial and error. You may not like the way you were raised and vow to be different from your own parents, or you see others raising children and disagree with their choices. (Judging the parenting choices of others has become an international pastime.) But what should you do instead? You don&#x2019;t want to be too strict, but is permissiveness the only alternative? You don&#x2019;t want to be overly �controlling&#x2014;�but how do you create order and consistency? You may worry that your mistakes will have too high a cost.<br><br>You have so many questions: Do I spank my child or not? If spanking is okay, how soon should I start? How do I communicate with an infant who �doesn&#x2019;t understand words? How do I get my child to listen? How do I handle a defiant toddler? How do I decide �what&#x2019;s �really important? How can I help my child develop a sense of �self-�worth, while teaching her responsibility, honesty, and kindness? How do I take care of myself so I can relax and enjoy this experience?<br><br>Advice is in plentiful �supply&#x2014;�grandparents, uncles, and aunts (and the lady behind you in line at the grocery store) will have lots of �it&#x2014;�but whose advice is right? Even the &#x201c;experts&#x201d; disagree. Some suggest punishment (even in the poorly disguised form of logical consequences), while others (including the authors and the latest brain research) suggest that punishment is not effective. Some claim rewards are important. Others (including the authors and many researchers) believe rewards teach manipulation and a reduced sense of �self-�worth instead of valuable social and life skills. It is our hope as authors, and as parents, that you will find answers in this book that will make sense to you, as well as clues to help you use your own wisdom, creativity, and knowledge of your child to go beyond what can be written in words.<br><br>This book is designed to be of use to both parents and their frequent partners in child rearing: childcare teachers, nannies, sitters, and relatives. Examples of home and childcare situations will be given throughout this book to show how the principles of Positive Discipline can be applied to all aspects of a young child&#x2019;s life. Developmental information and research will be included wherever appropriate, along with information about the way babies and young children grow and learn. Because it can be immensely helpful for all the adults who influence a child&#x2019;s life to have the same understanding about how to raise him, you may want to share this book with the staff at your childcare center, your babysitter, or other members of your family.<br><br>Your Family Is Your Family<br><br>All families, like all children, are different. Not all babies are born into �two-�parent families with a home in the suburbs, two cars, and a family dog. Your family may indeed look like that, or it may take a different shape altogether. You may be a single parent, through divorce or death or because you never married; you and your partner may have brought children from previous relationships, and added those you have had together; you may have �live-�in grandparents or other relatives; or you may share a home with friends and their children.You may be part of the LGBT community, or a particular ethnic group with its own valued traditions. In the end, what matters is the connection you build with your child and your commitment to respectful, effective parenting.<br><br>A family, it has been said, is a circle of people who love one another. Whatever form your family takes, remember that it will be whatever you have the courage to make it. With wisdom, patience, and love, you can create a home where your child feels safe, secure, and free to grow and learn, and where she can become a responsible, respectful, and resourceful �person&#x2014;�and where you will find joy in your parenting role.<br><br>What Do You Want for Your Child? The Importance of �Long-�Term Parenting<br><br>Life with an active toddler can make you feel like you&#x2019;re on a runaway train. The days zoom past, each one filled with new marvels, new discoveries, new crises. Parents often have to scurry to keep up with their young offspring and sometimes have little time available for thoughtful planning. But think for a moment: �Wouldn&#x2019;t it be helpful, as you set out on the journey of parenting, to have some idea of your final destination?<br><br>Perhaps one of the wisest things you can do right now is to take a moment to ask yourself a very important question: What is it that I �really want for my child? When your baby, your toddler, or your preschooler has grown into an adult (as impossible as that may seem now), what qualities and characteristics do you want this adult to have? You may decide that you want your child to develop responsibility, resilience, honesty, compassion, �self-�reliance, courage, and �gratitude&#x2014;�each parent&#x2019;s list will be a little different. What truly matters is this: From your child&#x2019;s earliest moments of life, the decisions you make as a parent will help shape his future. Each and every action you �take&#x2014;�whether or not you slap your child&#x2019;s hand as he reaches for a delicate object, how you deal with food thrown across the kitchen, or how you respond to bedtime �demands&#x2014;�can nurture or discourage those qualities you want to promote. Your child is constantly making decisions about himself and the world, and how to find belonging and significance in that world. These decisions are based on how he interprets his experiences in life, and they create his &#x201c;blueprint&#x201d; for living. Your actions and beliefs will have a strong influence on his decisions.<br><br>This idea feels overwhelming to most parents. You may be wondering, &#x201c;What if I make mistakes? How will I know what to do?&#x201d; Please, be reassured: Mistakes are not insurmountable failures, but valuable opportunities to learn. (Seeing mistakes as opportunities to learn is a fundamental concept of Positive Discipline.) Trying to protect your child from all mistakes is detrimental to learning resilience and developing a sense of capability. Both you and your child will make many mistakes along the way, but they needn&#x2019;t cause irreparable damage if you&#x2019;re willing to learn from them together. The most valuable parenting tools are those you already possess: your love for your child and your own inner wisdom and common sense. Learning to trust these instincts will carry you far along the road to successful parenting.<br><br>Remember, too, that children, especially very young children, learn by watching and imitating those around them. Your little one not only will want to push the vacuum or wash the dishes the way Mom, Dad, or Grandma does, but also will imitate the values you live by, such as honesty, kindness, and justice. When you use mistakes as opportunities to learn, your children will absorb this valuable attitude. Let your actions as a parent teach your child that he or she is loved and respected, that choices have consequences (not the kind you impose, but the kind you can help her explore), and that home is a safe and wonderful place to be.<br><br>A Word About Love<br><br>Many things are done to children (or withheld from children) in the name of love. &#x201c;I spank my children because I love them,&#x201d; parents say. Or &#x201c;I rescue and overprotect my children because I love them.&#x201d; &#x201c;I love my children, so I don&#x2019;t help them �much&#x2014;�they need to learn it&#x2019;s a tough world out there.&#x201d; &#x201c;I push my children (in toilet training, or early reading, or sports activities, or academic excellence) because I love them.&#x201d; &#x201c;I work long hours because I love my children and I want them to have everything I never had.&#x201d; &#x201c;I make decisions for my children because I love them too much to risk letting them make wrong choices.&#x201d; In this book, you will have an opportunity to explore the �long-�term effects of what you do in the name of love.<br><br>Parents often say that they feel overwhelmed by the intensity of their love for their children, and it is tempting to demonstrate that love by allowing children to do, say, and especially have whatever they want. Your �eighteen-�month-�old may be cute and adorable now when he grabs your smartphone out of your hands to play a game. You may even giggle when he tries out the �four-�letter word he learned from his older brother. Will it still be cute when he&#x2019;s five and does the same things?<br><br>Actually, whether you love your child is not the question. The real issue is whether you can show that love in ways that nurture accountability and a sense of capability, and that encourage your child to blossom into his full potential as a happy, contributing member of society. Eventually, most parents realize that genuine love requires that they love their children enough to set wise boundaries, to say no when they must, and to help them learn to live peacefully and respectfully in a world filled with other people.<br><br>Firm, Flexible, and Gentle<br><br>Imagine a tree, its roots anchoring it deep into the ground. Far above, at the tips of its slender branches, rests a �bird&#x2019;s nest. In that nest are one or more tiny, fragile eggs. When the wind blows, the �tree&#x2019;s branches sway in gentle arcs, but its grip on that small nest remains firm.<br><br>This image of gentleness combined with flexibility and firmness translates well to the task of parenting young children, and forms the foundation for many of the principles you will learn throughout this book. You can stand with your feet (or values) firmly rooted while still guiding your child with steady, gentle hands and a kind voice. This is not an easy task; it requires patience, energy, and boundless hope.<br><br>Redefining &#x201c;We&#x201d; and &#x201c;Me&#x201d;: Care for Parents<br><br>Adding &#x201c;parent&#x201d; to your definition of who you are means adding all sorts of new roles and responsibilities. It may also mean rearranging some of the roles you already have. One study found that many couples who had previously reported being happily married experienced a sharp drop in marital satisfaction after the arrival of a baby. Why?</p><h2>Other People&#39;s Children: Cultural Conflict in the Classroom</h2><p>By the year 2000, nearly 40 percent of the children in America&#39;s classrooms will be African American, Hispanic, Asian American, or Native American, yet most of those children&#39;s teachers will be white. In a radical and piercing analysis of what is going on in American classrooms today, MacArthur Award-winning author Lisa Delpit suggests that many of the academic problems attributed to children of color are actually the result of miscommunication as schools and &#34;other people&#39;s children&#34; struggle with the imbalance of power and the dynamics of inequality plaguing our system. Winner of Choice Magazine&#39;s Outstanding Academic Book Award, the American Education Studies Association Critics&#39; Choice Award, and one of Teacher Magazine&#39;s Great Books of 1995. Delpit is also a contributor to Racism Explained to My Daughter (New Press: June 1999).</p><p>A godsend. . . honest and fair, yet visionary and firm. -- <i>Quarterly Black Review</i><br><br>Here, finally, is multiculturalism with a human face. -- <i>Teacher Magazine</i><br><br>Phenomenal. . .

And there&#x2019;s your Bible&#x2015;buried under a pile of diapers. Bleary-eyed from lack of sleep, without a moment of peace and quiet, you wonder if the spiritual life you crave is even possible. But God sees you. He designed this parenting journey, after all. He understands the chaos of motherhood. And he joins you in everything&#x2015;whether you&#x2019;re scrubbing the floor, nursing a fussy newborn, or driving to soccer practice. Catherine McNiel invites you to connect with God right here, in the sacred mundane of every mothering moment.</p><p><p><b>Catherine McNiel</b> survived her children's preschool years by learning to find beauty in the mayhem. Now, she writes to open the eyes of weary moms to God's creative, redemptive work in each day. Catherine serves alongside her husband in a community-based ministry while she cares for three kids, works two jobs, and grows one enormous garden.</p>Here&#x2019;s a book for every Christian parent forced to smile through an exhortation to &#x201c;enjoy every moment; it&#x2019;s all over so fast!&#x201d; Catherine McNiel doesn&#x2019;t urge you to &#x201c;make time for God&#x201d; in early parenting but rather to see God there already: in the trial, in the joy, in the leaky diapers, plugged ducts, and scraped knees. Instead of being one more call to &#x201c;sleep when the baby sleeps,&#x201d; her book can help a weary parent wake up a bit more to the eternal life they&#x2019;re living. (Ted Olsen, Director of editorial development at Christianity Today)<br><br>Writing in the tradition of Brother Lawrence, Catherine McNiel shows readers how to keep company with God in the everyday. But she is no monastic. She is a mother, caught in the turbulence of life with small children. How I wish I&#x2019;d had this book&#x2015;and her example&#x2015;when I was just beginning my journey into motherhood. (Jen Pollock Michel, Author of the award-winning book Teach Us to Want)<br><br>Catherine&#x2019;s words are nothing short of a banquet table of nourishment for a hungry mama&#x2019;s soul. <i>Long Days of Small Things</i> invites the reader to see the mundane tasks of motherhood (changing diapers, folding laundry, planning meals, etc.)&#x2015;<i>not</i> as interruptions to our spiritual life&#x2015;but as an oft-overlooked path closer to Jesus. Accept Catherine&#x2019;s invitation, mom. Read and be seen, feel valued, and awaken to the beautiful, spiritual practice of motherhood. (Aubrey Sampson, Author of Overcomer)<br><br>Moms, if you don&#x2019;t have time to read a book, this is the book for you! If you hunger to connect to God, these words will nourish your deep places. On every page you will be reminded that your children don&#x2019;t distract you from the way&#x2015;they <i>are</i> the way to a richer, more meaningful life. Offering simple doable practices to connect to God, McNiel&#x2019;s beautifully woven words will strengthen you for your journey. (Margot Starbuck, Author of Small Things with Great Love)<br><br>Motherhood is about the sculpting of souls, and Catherine McNiel hands you desperately needed tools. Not only for the formation of your family&#x2015;but for your own soul. Let God do a holy, needful work through the pages you hold in your hands. (Ann Voskamp, mother of 7 and NYT bestselling author)<br><br>Catherine has written so beautifully of a woman&#x2019;s spiritual pathway to God. She has found the words to express what so many of us experience: repetitiveness of service that becomes a mysterious celebration of the sacredness of life and the presence of God. I wish I had written this book myself: a book that celebrates the spaghetti days of family, the wonder of pregnancy and birthing, and, above all, the sacredness of the journey.

Conventional views of the 18th century emphasize its political stability, aristocratic government, stately manners, and Georgian elegance. But Langford reveals another aspect of the times--a less orderly world of treasonous plots, rioting mobs, and Hogarthian vulgarity. Using the latest research and a wealth of techniques culled from a variety of disciplines, he tells an absorbing tale of remarkable contrasts and changes. An age often seen in static terms is brought to life with all its contradictions and tensions revealed.<br></p><p>It is the story of a transformation, or rather a series of transformations.

From the moment he arrived, Marsden found himself fascinated by the landscape around him, and, in particular, by the traces of human history&#x2014;and of the human relationship to the land&#x2014;that could be seen all around him. Wanting to experience the idea more fully, he set out to walk across Cornwall, to the evocatively named Land&#x2019;s End.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Rising Ground</i> is a record of that journey, but it is also so much more: a beautifully written meditation on place, nature, and human life that encompasses history, archaeology, geography, and the love of place that suffuses us when we finally find home. Firmly in a storied tradition of English nature writing that stretches from Gilbert White to Helen MacDonald, <i>Rising Ground</i> reveals the ways that places and peoples have interacted over time, from standing stones to footpaths, ancient habitations to modern highways. What does it mean to truly live in a place, and what does it take to understand, and honor, those who lived and died there long before we arrived?<br> &nbsp;<br> Like the best travel and nature writing, <i>Rising Ground</i> is written with the pace of a contemplative walk, and is rich with insight and a powerful sense of the long skein of years that links us to our ancestors.

He studied what constitutes the best in a human being, and which, in turn, determines a person&#x2019;s role in the world. Blending history and biography, Plutarch evokes the characters of great leaders in history. He systematically pairs a Greek with a Roman, comparing characters and lives with similar careers so as to serve his particular goal of moral instruction. In vivid prose, he describes the awesome spectacle of the actions of men of enormous desires and ambitions responding to impossible situations.</p><p><b>Plutarch</b> most likely was born in the 40s CE to a wealthy leading family. He studied in Athens and traveled widely through Greece and the empire, from Alexandria to Rome, but remained a lifelong resident of Chaeronea in Central Greece. He held several municipal and regional offices.&nbsp;<p>If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus. The vast extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of virtue and wisdom. The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of four successive emperors, whose characters and authority commanded involuntary respect.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward Gibbon, <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plutarch of Chaeronea wrote comparative lives of noble Greeks and Romans such as Pericles and Fabius, Demosthenes and Cicero, and Alexander and Caesar.&nbsp; He chose his subjects not for the greatness and interest of their careers so much as for the sake of the moral qualities revealed by the collision of formidable characters and powerful events.&nbsp; Fortunate himself to live at the dawn of the era Gibbon considered the happiest in human history, Plutarch took full advantage of the learning of his and past ages as well as his experience in public life to discover that which constitutes the best in a human being, and which, in turn, determines a person&#x2019;s role in the world.&nbsp; The subjects he chose as his examples live on memorably in his vivid narratives and strongly stated judgments.&nbsp; More than any other author from antiquity, Plutarch defined for all subsequent ages the character of Greek and Roman moral identity.<b></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ironically, we can recover the life of this most famous of biographers almost only from incidental references in his voluminous writings.&nbsp; For example, because he mentions that he was a young man when Nero visited Greece in 67 CE, Plutarch must have been born in the 40s CE. He came from a wealthy leading family in the small city of Chaeronea in Central Greece, famous not only for its biographer but also as the battlefield where Alexander&#x2019;s father, Philip, defeated the Greeks in 338 BCE and where the Roman general Sulla defeated the eastern monarch Mithridates VI in 86 BCE.&nbsp; Plutarch reports that relics of Sulla&#x2019;s battle continued to surface in the fields for two hundred years afterward, which means he was still alive in the 110s CE.&nbsp; Inscriptional evidence from Delphi, where he served as one of the two priests for life at the beginning of the sanctuary&#x2019;s second-century revival, suggests that he died before 125 CE.&nbsp; We meet several members of his family in his writings.&nbsp; His brother, father, grandfather (the witty, cultured Lamprias), and sons participate in some of the dialogs in the sprawling collection of essays called the <i>Moralia,</i> and he addressed the most touching of his essays, <i>Consolation</i>, to his wife, Timoxena, on the death of their daughter.&nbsp; Sympathetic to marriage, children, and women, Plutarch expected women to be literate and interested in philosophy.&nbsp; Proud of his origins even while he recognized their provinciality (see the opening of <i>Demosthenes</i>), he remained a lifelong resident of Chaeronea and held several municipal and regional offices.&nbsp; The people of Delphi and Chaeronea joined to honor Plutarch by setting up a statue of him in Delphi.</p><p>Plutarch also studied in Athens and traveled widely through Greece and the empire, from Alexandria to Rome.&nbsp; He had many friends in high positions within the imperial government, including Quintus Sosius Senecio, twice consul and dedicatee of several of the <i>Lives,</i> and Lucius Mestrius Florus, who evidently arranged for Plutarch to receive Roman citizenship; in gratitude Plutarch assumed the Romanized name Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus.&nbsp; Plutarch&#x2019;s interest in education has led many to believe he ran a school in Chaeronea, but there is little evidence for anything but widely ranging discussion at informal gatherings.</p><p><b></b>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plutarch lived at the beginning of the period Gibbon considered the most felicitous in human history.&nbsp; But, ironically, he grew up during the reign of Nero and lived through the calamitous eighteen months of civil war following it the two surviving of Plutarch&#x2019;s <i>Lives </i>of the emperors from Augustus to Vitellius belong to this period.&nbsp; He also experienced the catastrophic year 79 80 when Vesuvius erupted, plague decimated the empire, fire swept Rome, and when he saw his friends suffer under the harsh rule of Domitian (81 96).&nbsp; While the Romans enjoyed unprecedented peace and stability in the following half century, they knew how easily bad days could return: as Gibbon observed, so much depended on the quality of the man who ruled the empire and so the writers of the period weighed carefully the character of their rulers.&nbsp; Arnoldo Momigliano noted with appreciation the independence of the biographers of Plutarch&#x2019;s age: neither Tacitus, Suetonius, nor Plutarch became servants of imperial propaganda; rather they kept the emperors human.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he focused on individual lives and individuals&#x2019; characters in his writings, Plutarch offered some comments on the larger world; several of the essays, notably <i>Precepts on Statecraft,</i> treat the Roman context explicitly.&nbsp; The Roman Empire functioned not by coercing its subjects but by co-opting local elites, giving them responsibility for ensuring good order at the local level in return for keeping them in their positions of privilege.&nbsp; Plutarch believed that he lived in a world not only of security but also of considerable liberty which meant that those naturally suited to rule by virtue of wealth and birth had the freedom to control their cities without external interference.&nbsp; Liberty emphatically did not mean democracy, a system Plutarch attacked repeatedly in his writings: in his view, a democracy represents a city where the wise speak but fools decide.&nbsp; Notably, Flamininus&#x2019; proclamation of Greek liberty at the end of the Second Macedonian War in 196 BCE constitutes the climax of his life<i>,</i> Sulla&#x2019;s liberation of Athens from Mithridates offsets his sack of the city in 86 BCE, and Nero&#x2019;s gesture in freeing the Greeks in 67 CE redeems the otherwise monstrous emperor<i>.</i>&nbsp; But Emperor Vespasian (69 79 CE) revoked Nero&#x2019;s grant, and Plutarch spent all his adult life as a subject and then citizen of Rome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plutarch had no illusions about any possibility of the Greeks recovering their ancient liberty.&nbsp; Instead, Plutarch insisted, the role of Greek leaders was to lead free men within the empire, ensure local order and cooperation among local elites and with the imperial authorities, and to strike a balance between the independence that might occasion intervention by the imperial authorities and excessive dependency that might annoy them.&nbsp; The glories of ancient Greece that fill the Greek <i>Lives</i> serve as background to the analysis of the characters of her heroes, not inspiration for revolutionary activity.</p><p>If the <i>Lives</i> furnishes any advice for the contemporary statesman, it comes perhaps in <i>Phocion,</i> where Plutarch compares the duty of the statesman to the sun&#x2019;s gentle declination, dispensing his light and influence, in his annual revolution, at several seasons in just proportions to the whole creation.&#x201d;&nbsp; The ruler, by turns, must favor the people, but also hold them in check. But if such a blessed mixture and temperament may be obtained, it seems to be of all concords and harmonies the most concordant and most harmonious. For thus we are taught even God governs the world, not by irresistible force, but persuasive argument and reason, controlling it into compliance with his eternal purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>Plutarch goes on to insist that the Greek statesman should not look beyond Greek politics by pursing positions within the imperial administration.&nbsp; Romans had long developed friendships with Greeks, but only in the second century do we find the Greeks on the verge of the period when they, like other non-Italians, could attain positions of power in the Roman order and not limit themselves to the role of learned Greeks advising Romans.&nbsp; Plutarch himself became the acquaintance of many powerful Romans who attended his lectures and discussions, but except for the grant of citizenship and, possibly, consular honors, he did not appear to have taken advantage of those connections in any way beyond the pleasure of cultivated company.&nbsp; Plutarch&#x2019;s own rather modest political career therefore constitutes a model for how the Greek statesman should work within the empire.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One wonders why Plutarch paired Greeks and Romans in his <i>Parallel Lives.</i>&nbsp; D. A. Russell argued it was to demonstrate the parity and partnership of Greece and Rome, each with its contribution to make towards the development of political virtue,&#x201d; and to show how the humanity (<i>philanthropia</i>) that Greek moral education inculcated could modify Roman destructiveness.&nbsp; Others have seen in his project a reflection of the insecurity of the Greeks who wanted to equal the Romans on their terms military and political greatness rather than in the Greek sphere where the Romans acknowledged their inferiority: art and literature; thus Plutarch strove to prove the Greeks real men and the Romans civilized and not barbarian.&nbsp; C. P. Jones showed in <i>Plutarch and Rome</i> that this supposed diplomatic purpose never appears in the <i>Lives.</i>&nbsp; The very arrangement of the lives belies such a plan: it is haphazard, accidental, and dependent on chance just as much as life itself the sort of arrangement that can serve a study of morality in human life, not an argument about culture.&nbsp; Plutarch did not need to build a bridge between Greeks and Romans; the bridge already existed, well integrating Greece into the Roman order.&nbsp; Plutarch, Jones said, was both Greek, in that he saw himself as a Greek by birth and language, Roman, in that his interests and sympathies are bound up with the empire.&#x201d;&nbsp; Robert Lamberton argued that Plutarch actually helped create the Athenocentric interpretation of Greek culture that influenced Hadrian&#x2019;s program to elevate Athens to a position analogous to Rome&#x2019;s: Plutarch&#x2019;s <i>Parallel Lives</i> constitute the principal document in the high empire&#x2019;s reinvention of Classical Greece.&#x201d;&nbsp; Plutarch&#x2019;s way of interpreting Greece and Rome proved so powerful that his became the standard way of understanding antiquity as opposed to, say, the Virgilian model in which Rome prevails in law and government, Greece in arts and literature.&nbsp; The lives of the mythical heroes Theseus and Romulus, Lycurgus and Numa, for whom limited information enabled considerable flexibility on Plutarch&#x2019;s part, above all show the biographer&#x2019;s interest in elevating Greece into Rome&#x2019;s sphere of action: these lives really compare Athens and Rome and Greek and Roman institutions, not individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Plutarch&#x2019;s own stated purpose did not involve the elucidation of themes of cultural difference or liberty; morality constituted his primary interest, and he used great lives to reveal great character.&nbsp; Perhaps we should see Plutarch&#x2019;s biographical choices as the product not so much of a great Greco-Roman cultural project but rather as an exploration of character in those who most strongly demonstrated powerful moral qualities: the insatiable ambition of Marius, the pitiless inhumanity of Sulla, the sublime excessiveness of Alexander, the sheer power-hunger of Caesar, the futile idealism of the younger Cato, the charismatic immorality of Alcibiades, the uxorious helplessness of Antony, the impressive fairness of Aristides, the inhumane self-righteousness of Cato the Elder, the embarrassing self-importance of Cicero, the baffling bad luck of Sertorius.&nbsp; These biographical choices will be explored in the introduction to volume 2.&nbsp; Here we shall consider the lasting influence of Plutarch.<b></b></p><p><b></b>&nbsp;</p><p>The last generation of scholars has credited Plutarch with great originality and creativity as he pursued his intellectual and moral projects.&nbsp; Earlier scholars, however, considered his work important not in itself, but for the way it transmitted antiquity to later generations.&nbsp; And indeed, no one can deny the fact that already in his own lifetime Plutarch&#x2019;s readers derived their understanding of their Greco-Roman past largely through his eyes.&nbsp; The <i>Parallel Lives</i> became an instant classic, widely quoted and excerpted in antiquity.&nbsp; The Byzantine scholar Planudes collected and edited all the Plutarchan manuscripts he could find about 1300.&nbsp; The <i>Lives</i> saw their first translations in the fourteenth (into Aragonese and Tuscan) and fifteenth (into Latin) centuries, often for political motives.&nbsp; Thus Bruni, interested in the Republican origins of Florence, translated the life of the last Republican, Cato the Younger; the Venetians, in contrast, interested in the maritime East, preferred the Athenian general Phocion.&nbsp; The sixteenth century saw many vernacular translations even Queen Elizabeth translated one of the essays into English but pride of place goes to Amyot&#x2019;s French translation (<i>Lives</i> in 1559, <i>Moralia</i> in 1572), which itself served as the source for Thomas North&#x2019;s translation of the <i>Lives</i> (1579, with new editions in 1595 and 1603) into the English version Shakespeare knew, as did most English-speaking readers until the version edited by Dryden appeared a century later.</p><p>Thus the Plutarchan view of antiquity persisted through the end of the Roman Empire and was revived in the Renaissance and Early Modern Period when Shakespeare drew on his writings as his source for the Roman tragedies and Montesquieu proclaimed Plutarch my man.&#x201d;&nbsp; After the heroic age of Rousseau and Franklin, Plutarch went into decline on account of what seemed excessive moralizing and unthinking borrowing of earlier authors; nevertheless, he has continued to impart political wisdom to statesmen such as Harry Truman and Eugene McCarthy as well as memorable vignettes of Greek and Roman history to undergraduate students.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;John Dryden (1631 1700) himself contributed only an essay on the life of Plutarch to the great translation of the <i>Parallel Lives</i> that bears his name.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Dryden deserves credit for soliciting translations of the individual lives, editing them, and arranging for their publication by Jacob Tonson in five volumes from 1683 to 1686 (second edition in 1688, third in 1693).&nbsp; Arthur Sherbo has shown that in the last two decades of his life Dryden assembled a team of gentlemen, many of whom he knew from his days at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he first read Plutarch in the mid-1600s.&nbsp; They contributed original poetry as well as translations from the class...</p></p><h2>An Intellectual History of Modern Europe</h2><p>With the unifying theme of the Enlightenment tradition and two introductory chapters on the evolution of Western intellectual tradition, the text provides students with the framework and background they need to understand the history of modern European thought.

When growth falters, politicians panic, businesses fail, people lose jobs, and recession looms.

And this is why Peter Constantine&#x2019;s thoughtful translation is such a pleasure, presenting all the book&#x2019;s subtlety and ribald joys precisely as Voltaire had intended. <br><br>The globe-trotting misadventures of the youthful Candide; his tutor, Dr. Pangloss; Martin, and the exceptionally trouble-prone object of Candide&#x2019;s affections, Cun�gonde, as they brave exile, destitution, cannibals, and numerous deprivation, provoke both belly laughs and deep contemplation about the roles of hope and suffering in human life. <br><br>The transformation of Candide&#x2019;s outlook from panglossian optimism to realism neatly lays out Voltaire&#x2019;s philosophy&#x2013;that even in Utopia, life is less about happiness than survival&#x2013;but not before providing us with one of literature&#x2019;s great and rare pleasures.</p><p>Political satire doesn't age well, but occasionally a diatribe contains enough art and universal mirth to survive long after its timeliness has passed. <i>Candide</i> is such a book. Penned by that Renaissance man of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, <i>Candide</i> is steeped in the political and philosophical controversies of the 1750s. But for the general reader, the novel's driving principle is clear enough: the idea (endemic in Voltaire's day) that we live in the best of all possible worlds, and apparent folly, misery and strife are actually harbingers of a greater good we cannot perceive, is hogwash.<p> Telling the tale of the good-natured but star-crossed Candide (think Mr. Magoo armed with deadly force), as he travels the world struggling to be reunited with his love, Lady Cunegonde, the novel smashes such ill-conceived optimism to splinters. Candide's tutor, Dr. Pangloss, is steadfast in his philosophical good cheer, in the face of more and more fantastic misfortune; Candide's other companions always supply good sense in the nick of time. Still, as he demolishes optimism, Voltaire pays tribute to human resilience, and in doing so gives the book a pleasant indomitability common to farce. Says one character, a princess turned one-buttocked hag by unkind Fate: "I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most melancholy propensities; for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one's very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?"<i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><p>In this new translation of Voltaire&#x2019;s best-known work, distinguished translator Burton Raffel captures the irreverent spirit of <i>Candide and </i>renders the novel in clear, vivacious English. Stylistically superior to all predecessors, Raffel&#x2019;s version now stands as the translation of choice for twenty-first-century readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Economics (with Digital Assets, 2 term (12 months) Printed Access Card)</h2><p>Ever wonder why you have the number of friends that you do?

Why is it that the Army is always prepared for war in Europe, but was caught off guard in Korea and Vietnam? In The Masks of War Carl H. Builder asks what motives lie behind the puzzling and often contradictory behavior of America&#39;s military forces. The answer, he finds, has little to do with what party controls the White House or who writes the budget. Far more powerful--and glacially resistant to change-are the entrenched institutions and distinct &#34;personalities&#34; of the three armed services themselves: - The Navy sees itself mainly as heir to a glorious tradition dating back to the British navy. Equipped with its own land and air force, it jealously guards its independence and is happiest when left alone. - The Air Force is the embodiment of a single idea-one that also happens to be a strategy of war. Not love of &#34;the Air Force&#34; but love of flight and flying machines binds its members together. - Traditionally, the Army has considered itself the nation&#39;s servant, charged with teaching citizen-soldiers the art of war in times of crisis. But heady memories of triumph in the closing months of World War II contradict this modest role. Is today&#39;s Army &#34;schizophrenic&#34;? The Masks of War explains why things sometimes go wrong for the American military. It also explains why things will always go wrong for military reformers. Changes in the military&#39;s strategic thinking have come only in the wake of full-blown disaster - Pearl Harbor, for instance. Today&#39;s nuclear world can&#39;t afford such lessons. &#34;Few of us will agree with everything in this provocative book. All of us, however, will benefit from the author&#39;s invitation to look beyond what the strategists, analysts, and even the military services themselves say they are doing in the name of military planning and national security in an effort to understand why the military services act as they do.</p><p><p>"Builder's provocative book is institutional profile at its best, probing far beyond the flip phrases that usually describe the essence of each service, e.g., that the Air Force likes things it can fly."</p> (<i>Foreign AffairsA RAND Corporation Research Study</i>)</p><h2>God&#x2019;s Universe</h2><p><p>We live in a universe with a very long history, a vast cosmos where things are being worked out over unimaginably long ages. Stars and galaxies have formed, and elements come forth from great stellar cauldrons. The necessary elements are present, the environment is fit for life, and slowly life forms have populated the earth. Are the creative forces purposeful, and in fact divine? </p><p>Owen Gingerich believes in a universe of intention and purpose. We can at least conjecture that we are part of that purpose and have just enough freedom that conscience and responsibility may be part of the mix. They may even be the reason that pain and suffering are present in the world. The universe might actually be comprehensible.</p><p>Taking Johannes Kepler as his guide, Gingerich argues that an individual can be both a creative scientist and a believer in divine design--that indeed the very motivation for scientific research can derive from a desire to trace God's handiwork. The scientist with theistic metaphysics will approach laboratory problems much the same as does his atheistic colleague across the hall. Both are likely to view the astonishing adaptations in nature with a sense of surprise, wonder, and mystery. </p><p>In <i>God's Universe</i> Gingerich carves out "a theistic space" from which it is possible to contemplate a universe where God plays an interactive role, unnoticed yet not excluded by science.</p></p><p>Owen Gingerich is Professor of Astronomy and of the History of Science, Emeritus, at the Harvard&#x2013;Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.This little book--intelligent, provocative, and respectful of a range of views--shows how a modern scientist can support both evolution and intelligent design and, more generally, offers a meeting place for science and religion. (Alan Lightman)<br><br>In <i>God's Universe</i> Owen Gingerich makes the case that the probability is miraculously minute, first, that a planet hospitable to life could form after the Big Bang and, second, that once it had formed, intelligent life could develop there. Whether one agrees or disagrees, one will learn from this beautifully presented account of the relevant astronomy and physics. But that isn't all; Gingerich's reflections (as a liberal Christian) on the theological significance of all this are sensitive and deep. A truly fascinating read. (Hilary Putnam)<br><br>This is a timely and important book. In contrast to the shrill dogmatics on both sides of the current intelligent design debate, Gingerich offers a sweeping and authoritative account of our continuing encounter with, and understanding of, the Universe of which we find ourselves a part. Meticulous in its scholarship, humane in its approach, generous in its tone, restrained in its assertions, but audacious in its scope, this little book is a solid and significant contribution to the ongoing debate. (Frank Rhodes, President Emeritus, Cornell University)<br><br>Writing in a style that is accessible and laced with interesting historical anecdote, Owen Gingerich uses his expertise in astronomy and its history, together with the insights of his Christian faith, to give a well-argued account of humanity's place in the cosmos. (Reverend Dr. John Polkinghorne)<br><br>I have always felt the words should be "Science and Religion"--not "Science or Religion." Owen Gingerich offers both intellectual heft and spiritual stamina to back up that claim. This slim volume will pay rich dividends to the seeking mind and the longing soul. (Dr. Tim Johnson)<br><br>Gingerich pleads for separating physics from metaphysics, efficient causes from final causes, how from why...In the end, he persuaded even a hardened skeptic like me that there might, possibly, be more to the cosmos than is dreamt of in my philosophy. (George Scialabba <i>Boston Globe</i> 2006-07-23)<br><br>Gingerich's work is a survey of the conflicts--and confluences--between hard science and deep faith; along the way he provides a brief but magisterial history of science that is as astute as it is original. He's a superb writer too, handling scientific and theological complexities with equal aplomb but enlivening his account throughout with poetry, dramatic anecdote, and snippets of autobiography...Because he is also steeped in science, both as researcher and historian, Mr. Gingerich is aware of how improbable and even fantastic his Christian faith must appear to skeptical colleagues. In slipping so effortlessly into both realms--provable fact and unsearchable mystery--Mr. Gingerich reminds me of some adroit intellectual amphibian, calmly at home in contiguous but incompatible terrains...A sense of wonder animates this book, but it's never the swooning and manipulative wonder of such showmen as the late Carl Sagan; rather, it's the verifiable fact in its specificity, abetted by the promise of some final cause beyond all our telescopes, which informs Mr. Gingerich's awe. (Eric Ormsby <i>New York Sun</i> 2006-09-13)<br><br>Astronomer Gingerich believes in a designed universe, though not in intelligent design (ID), the anti-evolution theorizing that some evangelical Christian activists want taught in public-school science courses. His intent isn't, however, to flay ID as Michael Shermer does in <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>; it is to explore a few topics in science that suggest design and a designer, God. He weighs the Copernican principle that intelligent life isn't exceptional in the universe against the Darwinian emphasis on the uniqueness of life on earth. He probes the differences between atheist and religious scientists (this is where he dismisses ID along with evolution as a materialist philosophy as ideologies), especially over the big bang and cosmological teleology. Finally, he raises some Questions without Answers to point up the different, irreconcilable concerns of physics as opposed to metaphysics, science as opposed to religion. Utterly lacking scientific or religious triumphalism, demonstrating why both ways of knowing are indispensable, Gingerich's highly re-readable remarks may well outlast all the brouhaha of the ID-evolution fracas. (Ray Olson <i>Booklist</i> 2006-08-01)<br><br>In his slim and elegant new book, <i>God's Universe</i>, Gingerich finds that indeed everywhere he looks he can discern the hand of a benevolent Creator--all without compromising his adherence to a rigorous methodological scientific naturalism...Despite the fact that as an atheist I do not see the hand of God in the universe--I found myself cheering for this lucid and poetic little book...In this time of sectarian wars, when theists and atheists are engaged in <br>increasingly hostile incivilities, Gingerich lays out an elegant case for why he finds the universe a source of encouragement for his life both as a scientist and as a Christian. We do not have to agree with his conclusions to be buoyed and enchanted by the journey on which he takes us. (Margaret Wertheim <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> 2006-11-12)<br><br>Gingerich's <i>God's Universe</i> is the brief and elegant apologia of an emeritus professor of astronomy and the history of science at Harvard University. As a historian of science, Gingerich is well aware of the complexities involved in producing scientific and religious knowledge. The history of science is one in which progress is made through the 'persuasive coherency' of the new picture that is presented, rather than through simple knock-down proofs. It is at this general level of world pictures that Gingerich's Christian faith generally finds its expression.

In this book, Pascale Casanova shows us the state of world literature behind the stylistic refinements--a world of letters relatively independent from economic and political realms, and in which language systems, aesthetic orders, and genres struggle for dominance. Rejecting facile talk of globalization, with its suggestion of a happy literary "melting pot," Casanova exposes an emerging regime of inequality in the world of letters, where minor languages and literatures are subject to the invisible but implacable violence of their dominant counterparts.</p><p>Inspired by the writings of Fernand Braudel and Pierre Bourdieu, this ambitious book develops the first systematic model for understanding the production, circulation, and valuing of literature worldwide. Casanova proposes a baseline from which we might measure the newness and modernity of the world of letters--the literary equivalent of the meridian at Greenwich. She argues for the importance of literary capital and its role in giving value and legitimacy to nations in their incessant struggle for international power. Within her overarching theory, Casanova locates three main periods in the genesis of world literature--Latin, French, and German--and closely examines three towering figures in the world republic of letters--Kafka, Joyce, and Faulkner. Her work provides a rich and surprising view of the political struggles of our modern world--one framed by sites of publication, circulation, translation, and efforts at literary annexation.</p></p><p>Pascale Casanova is an associated researcher at the Center for Research in Arts and Language and a literary critic in Paris. She is the author of <i>Beckett the Abstractor</i> (Paris, 1997), winner of the Grand Prix de l&#x2019;Essai de la Soci�t� des Gens de Lettres.This is a marvelous study of the international networks and ethnic forcefields out of which a modern world literature has emerged. In drawing a map of the literary globe, Pascale Casanova shows just how different it is from any political map ever framed. Unlike many previous comparativists, she shows just how many of the texts of literary modernism have been contributed by peoples without financial or political power. This is a brave, audacious and luminous analysis, and a bracing challenge to those who still believe in the nation as an explanatory category. This book will provoke debate for years to come. (Declan Kiberd, author of <i>Inventing Ireland</i> and <i>Irish Classics</i>)<br><br>As a researcher, Pascale Casanova specializes in the exception. Along with a literary knowledge that is exceptional in its breadth and depth, she possesses a theoretical knowledge that is truly vast and wielded with great authority. In pursuing this immense topic - the universe of relations that constitute the "World Republic of Letters" - she has set herself a daunting challenge: that of constructing, and empirically verifying, a theoretical model for the "fabric of the universal." (Pierre Bourdieu, author of <i>Distinction</i> and <i>Language and Symbolic Power</i>)<br><br>The book is remarkable for its multidisciplinary and transnational approach, and for the response it has excited in Japan as well as many other countries, where it will surely continue to inspire lively debate. (Hidehiro Tachibana, Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan))<br><br>Casanova's book is a major contribution to modern literary theory. It effectively shatters national boundaries. (Gilles Lapouge, O Estado de S�o Paolo (Brazil))<br><br>Corpus literarium universalis... What is interesting is that Casanova reads a series of concrete events in the history of the "republic," showing the need... for constant interpellation of aesthetic and linguistic notions. (Patricia de Souza, El Pa�s (Madrid, Spain))<br><br>The great majority of writers in a language outside the Atlantic core who have gained an international reputation have done so by introductory passage through the medium of French, not English: from Borges, Mishima and Gombrowicz, to Carpentier, Mahfouz, Krleza or Cortazar, up to Gao Xinjiang, the recent Chinese Nobel Prize-winner. The system of relations that has produced this pattern of Parisian consecration is the object of Pascale Casanova's [<i>The World Republic of Letters</i>], [an] outstanding example of an imaginative synthesis with strong critical intent...Here the national bounds of Bourdieu's work have been decisively broken, in a project that uses his concepts of symbolic capital and the cultural field to construct a model of the global inequalities of power between different national literatures, and the gamut of strategies that writers in languages at the periphery of the system of legitimation have used to try to win a place at the centre. Nothing like this has been attempted before. The geographical range of Casanova's materials, from Madagascar to Romania, Brazil to Switzerland, Croatia to Algeria; the clarity and trenchancy of the map of unequal relations she offers; and, not least, the generosity with which the dilemmas and ruses of the disadvantaged are explored, make her book kindred to the French �lan behind the World Social Forum. It might be called a literary Porto Alegre. That implies a beginning, with much fierce argument and discussion to come. But whatever the outcome of ensuing criticisms or objections, <i>The World Republic of Letters</i>--empire more than a republic, as Casanova shows--is likely to have the same sort of liberating impact at large as Said's <i>Orientalism</i>, with which it stands comparison. (Perry Anderson <i>London Review of Books</i> 2004-09-23)<br><br>[A] brilliant, groundbreaking book...Casanova's work amounts to a radical remapping of global literary space...Casanova parts company with the historicism that has swept literary studies over the past two decades. Rather than tying literary phenomena to underlying social and political developments, she charts an autonomous history for literature itself. The world republic of letters is governed by its own rules, keeps time by its own historical clock, partitions the world according to its own map and features its own economics, its own inequalities and its own forms of violence...Casanova devotes the second half of her book to exploring the means by which writers from the literary periphery have sought to break into the center--a myriad of struggles whose existence has heretofore been concealed by 'the fable of an enchanted world...where universality reigns through liberty and equality.' The breadth of her scholarship here is staggering: from South America to North Africa, Eastern Europe to East Asia; from the emergent Modernism of Ibsen and Yeats to the most recent postcolonial hybridities; from 'assimilationists' like Naipul and Cioran to 'rebels' like Neruda and Achebe...She has created a map of global literary power relations where none had existed, and she has raised a host of further questions. (William Deresiewicz <i>The Nation</i> 2005-01-03)<br><br>There is a great deal more to this path-breaking study, not least a superb sketch of Franz Kafka, who is depicted caught between Yiddish, Czech and German, high modernism and popular nationalism. There are portraits of exiles or 'translated men' such as Joyce and Samuel Beckett who are adrift between cultures, adept at being homeless in a whole number of languages. And there are snapshots of 'assimilations' such as V S Naipaul, who eagerly identify with the imperial heritage that uprooted their own people. Casanova's range of literary allusions, from Berlin to Havana, Norway to Somalia, is astonishing...This book, which unlike many other works of literary theory is written (or at any rate translated) with exemplary lucidity, represents a milestone in the history of modern literary thought. (Terry Eagleton <i>New Statesman</i> 2005-04-11)<br><br>A heroically ambitious new book...aims to put this quest for literary hegemony into a deep historical context. <i>The World Republic of Letters</i> by Pascale Casanova travels far and wide, from French Renaissance disputes over the language of literature to the recent fashion for post-colonial fiction--from Ronsard to Rushdie...Casanova (well-known in France as a critic and broadcaster) follows the battle waged by writers on the margins of the system to carve out a space in which a truly autonomous 'republic of letters' can flourish...Casanova's book is a demanding, rewarding read...She draws a remarkably rich and persuasive map of global writing and publishing not as 'an enchanted world that exists outside time,' but as a battlefield on which dominant languages and cultures have always wielded the heavy weapons. (Boyd Tonkin <i>The Independent</i> 2005-03-11)<br><br>Learned and important...It denies the existence of a so-called 'world republic of letters' that is open to all talents and that judges according to universal aesthetic standards...Casanova remaps the fantasy of a homogenized global space into regions of centers and peripheries, rigidly divided into a 'tacit and implacable hierarchy.' Between these regions she identifies only a few gates, guarded by powerful gatekeepers with murky agendas...[She] argues that as concentrations of literary 'capital' are uneven, so are judgments of literary value...The book offers several excellent analyses of 'small national literatures'...This is an original book.

Richard Friman, Eliot Fitch Professor of International Studies, Marquette University author of Patchwork Protectionism</p>In The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy, business professor Pietra Rivoli takes the reader on a fascinating around-the-world adventure to reveal the life story of her six-dollar T-shirt. Traveling from a West Texas cotton field to a Chinese factory, and from trade negotiations in Washington to a used clothing market in Africa, Rivoli examines international trade through the life story of this simple product. Combining a compelling story with substantive scholarship, Rivoli shows that both globalization's critics and its cheerleaders have oversimplified the world of international trade. <p>As Rivoli spoke with businesspeople around the world who played a part in her T-shirt's life, she was forced to confront her own assumptions about the political, economic, and ethical effects of globalization. Trained as a classical economist, Rivoli expected the story of her T-shirt to reveal the undeniable benefits of global free trade and the misguided ideas of the anti-globalization movement. Instead, she found that "free markets" usually aren't free; that even the staunchest allies of free trade regularly benefit from its restriction; and that the alleged "victims" of globalization are often its greatest beneficiaries. While the globalization debate remains centered on the perils versus the promise of competitive economic markets, Rivoli finds that the life story of her T-shirt turns as much on power and politics as it does on markets.</p> <p>The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy uses a simple T-shirt to reveal the politics and the human side of the globalization debate. Within the fabric of every product are fascinating</p> <p>businesses, good and bad politics, revealing histories, and especially the hopes and dreams of real people. These people's stories&#x2014;and the story of the T-shirt that ties them together&#x2014;present the most nuanced look yet at the economics and politics of globalization.</p></p><h2>The Photographer&#39;s Vision: Understanding and Appreciating Great Photography</h2><p><p>In The Photographer's Eye, Michael Freeman showed what a photographer needs to do in the instant before the shutter is released. In the sequel, The Photographer's Mind, he explained the way that professional photographers think a picture through before taking it. Both of these international best-sellers featured Michael's own photography: stunning landscapes, revealing portraits, and fascinating street photography.&nbsp;Now, in The Photographer's Vision, he examines the work of photography's greats, explaining how to look at a photo - and how to learn from looking at it.</p></p><p><p></p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive: "What Makes a Good Photograph," an Excerpt from <i>Photographer's Vision</i></strong> <p></p><p></p><b>Takes directly from real life</b> <br>Although the camera can be used to construct images, particularly in studio work, the great strength of photography is that the physical world around us provides the material. This elevates the importance of the subject, the event; and the reporting of this is obviously something at which photography excels. At the same time, however, this ease of capture reduces the value of accurate representation, because it has become commonplace--very different from the early view of painting, when Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his notebook that "painting is most praiseworthy which is most like the thing represented." Instead, the way in which photographers document--the style and treatment--becomes more significant.At a deeper level, there is an inherent paradox between depicting reality and yet being something completely apart as a freestanding image. Other arts, like painting, poetry, and music, are obvious as constructs. There is no confusion in anyone's mind that a poem or a song have originated anywhere else but in the mind of their creator, and that the experience in life that they refer to has been filtered through an imagination, and that some time has been taken to do this. In this respect, photographs do create confusion. The image is, in most cases, so clearly of a real scene, object, or person, and yet it remains just an image that can be looked at quietly in completely divorced circumstances. It is of real life, and at the same time separate. This contradiction offers many possibilities for exploration, and much contemporary fine- art photography does just that, including making constructions to mimic real-life content. <p></p><b>Fast and easy</b> <br>Photography can explore and capture all aspects of life--and increasingly so as the equipment improves. One example of this is the increased light sensitivity of sensors, which has made night and low-light imagery possible. We take this pretty much for granted, but it is a strong driving force behind photography's immense popularity. Little or no preparation is needed to capture an image, which means that there are many, many opportunities for creative expression. As digital cameras make this easier and more certain technically, it also focuses more and more attention on the composition and on each person's particular vision. Or at least it should, provided we don't get sidetracked by the "bright, shiny toy" component in photography. "Photography is the easiest art," wrote photographer Lisette Model, "which perhaps makes it the hardest." There is unquestionably less craftsmanship in photography in the sense of time and physical effort than there is in other visual arts, something many professionals feel defensive about. But in its place, the act of creation is extended afterwards to reviewing and selecting already-taken images. As well as editing, as this is called, the processing and printing of images is also a later and important part of the process. <p></p><b>Can be taken by anyone</b> <br>This never happened in art before. Photography is now practiced nearly universally, and not just to record family moments, either. It's no longer a case of artists and professionals on one side, audience on the other. Digital cameras, sharing across the internet, and the decline of traditional print media have made photography available to almost everyone as a means of creative expression. Nor do these many millions of photographers feel bound by the opinions of a few. Many are perfectly happy with the opinions of their peers, as audience and photographers are usually the same people. All of this makes contemporary photography wide-ranging and complex, with different and competing standards and values. Creating good photographs does not depend on a career plan, which for all save professionals is good news. What is less good is that a large number of images tends to confuse any judgement of excellence, and the internet is awash with imagery. <p></p><b>Has a specific look</b> <br>Whatever choice of paper texture and coating you make for a print, the image itself is completely without a third dimension. The frame is a window, and this sets photography apart from painting and from any kind of imagery created by hand. In many ways, this lack of physical presence makes screen display perfect, and this is increasingly how most photographs get viewed. In terms of its look, photography begins with the viewer's expectation that the contents are "real"--taken from real life. In fact, we relate the appearance of a photograph to two things: how we ourselves see, and how we have learned to accept the look of a photograph. We are very sensitive to the naturalism and "realism" of a photograph. The further that a photographer takes the image away from this, by complicated processing or unusual post-production techniques, the less the image is photographic. This is not a criticism, just a statement of obvious fact. The basic photographic look relies on the assumption that very little has been done to the image since it was captured. Photography also has its own vocabulary of imagery, not found anywhere else. This includes such things as differential focus, a limited dynamic range, motion blur, flare artefacts, less-than-fully-saturated colors, and the possibility of rendering the image entirely in black and white. <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><br> <b>From the series Four Seasons in One Day, 2007, by Laura El-Tantawy</b><br> A warm afternoon graces central London as pedestrians cool down with ice cream cones. Differential focus, and even some slight motion blur, together with the smoothness of the tonal range, make this a very &#x201c;photographic&#x201d; image, despite the ways in which the photographer plays with illusion and juxtaposition. It presents itself as capture from the real world, rather than a manipulated illustration, and it&#x2019;s this given that allows El-Tantawy to experiment and to intrigue with her distinct way of seeing. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>Michael Freeman is a renowned international photographer and writer who specializes in travel, architecture, and Asian art.

In the tradition of social critiques such as Christopher Lasch&#x2019;s <i>The Culture of Narcissism</i>, <i>Against Love</i> keenly examines the meaning and cultural significance of adultery, arguing that perhaps the question concerns not only the private dilemma of whether or not to be faithful, but also the purpose of this much vaunted fidelity.<br><br>With a novelist&#x2019;s eye for detail, psychological acuity, and linguistic panache, Kipnis at once humorously and seriously explores the rules and rituals of modern coupledom and domesticity (from the establishment of curfews and whereabouts to actual searches and seizures), even as she deftly analyzes the larger power structures that they serve. She wonders: Might adulterers be regarded not only as sexual renegades but as unwitting social theorists posing essential political questions about the social contract itself? What is the trade-off between personal gratification and the renunciations society demands of us? And is &#x201c;working at your relationship&#x201d; just another way of propping up the work ethic�as if we weren&#x2019;t all overworked enough as it is? If adultery is ultimately a referendum on the sustainability of monogamy, how credible is the basic premise of modern coupledom: that desire for your one and only love can and will persist through a lifetime of togetherness (despite so much evidence to the contrary)?<br><br><i>Against Love</i> offers no easy answers. Rather it intends to engage you in a commonsensical and brave examination of the plight of the modern personality, caught between the vicissitudes of desire and the decrees of social conformity.</p><p>Less against love than against the cultural constraints that leads us to create wrong-headed ideas of love, this is book is the perfect antidote to any lingering social guilt about being happily single. <i>Against Love: A Polemic</i> will both shock and irritate, especially when you find yourself nodding your head in agreement while laughing at another broken taboo. Laura Kipnis (author of <i>Bound and Gagged</i>, <i>Ecstasy Unlimited</i>) clearly enjoyed writing this; she lets her wit run rampage over classic married situations and human emotions with results that include comparing adulterers to freedom fighters (using sharpened spoons to tunnel out from under love's barbed wire fences) and referring to tearful confessions of cheating as "funny little couple rituals." These make it fun, but the iconoclastic beauty is in her questions. How did good relationships come to be considered work instead of play? Why, unlike most of history and many other modern cultures, do Americans assume love and marriage go hand-in-hand? What lead to infidelity committed by public figures becoming a source of outrage? Kipnis doesn't have answers. Although urging us to have more compassion for our own desires, she expects her readers are smart enough to supply their own in response to her ideas. That attitude itself is a treat--if you're prepared to keep up through a complex whirlwind of Freud, Marx, Gingrich, Wollstonecraft, and several generations of pop culture. <i>Jill Lightner</i>&#x201c;Laura Kipnis&#x2019;s witty and cunning treatise against modern love is as trenchant and unexpected, as jubilantly incendiary a work of social criticism as I&#x2019;ve read in years. It is an explosive pleasure.&#x201d;<br>--Edward Hirsch<br><br><i>&#x201c;Against Love</i> is a wonderfully provocative book, daring and incisive, written with verve and no small amount of humor. It raises a thousand questions most of us lack the courage to ask, about domestic life and even the meaning of the human enterprise, while remaining at every instant a delight to read.&#x201d;<br>--Scott Turow<br><br>&#x201c;Deeply subversive, tough-minded, clear-thinking, provocative and shrewd, <i>Against Love</i> has the nerve to wonder out loud if marriage has evolved into an instrument of social control. Yet what&#x2019;s so winning about Kipnis&#x2019;s manifesto is its high-spirited lack of cynicism; she is not so much against love as for honesty.&#x201d;<br>--James Atlas</p><h2>SuperVision and Instructional Leadership: A Developmental Approach (9th Edition) (Allyn &amp; Bacon Educational Leadership)</h2><p><p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

Barnes gives the fullest available narrative history of the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine. He analyzes Constantine&#x2019;s rise to power and his government, demonstrating how Constantine&#x2019;s sincere adherence to Christianity advanced his political aims. He explores the whole range of Eusebius&#x2019; writings, especially those composed before Constantine became emperor, and shows that many attitudes usually deemed typical of the &#x201c;Constantinian revolution&#x201d; were prevalent before the new Christian empire came into existence. This authoritative political and cultural history of the age of Constantine will prove essential to students and historians of the ancient world.</p></p><p>Timothy D.

Men are still capable of reproduction well into and beyond middle age. Yet a man&#x2019;s sexual desire and potency varies, often according to his testosterone level. Recent studies show that the lowered testosterone levels endemic in aging men--a gradual drop that is quite normal--are being exacerbated by environmental agents. Testosterone-blocking estrogen agents are present in insecticides, industrial materials, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Men are daily inundated with a &#x201c;cocktail&#x201d; of estrogen agents that alter the fine balance of testosterone that makes them male. But as recent medical research has revealed, testosterone replacement therapy with Low T drugs is not a good option because of the increased risk of cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke, and because the body can become dependent on pharmaceutical testosterone and stop producing any on its own. <br> <br>In this updated edition of <i>The Natural Testosterone Plan</i>, Stephen Harrod Buhner shows why men need help to maintain their testosterone levels as they age and explains how naturally occurring phytoandrogens--plant medicines that contain male hormones--can safely remedy the depletion exerted by the environment. Buhner details how each phytoandrogen works, when its use is indicated, and the most appropriate method of application, providing all men with safe, natural, and effective means of maintaining optimum testosterone levels well into old age.</p><p>Stephen Harrod Buhner is the senior researcher for the Foundation for Gaian Studies.

Many authors have given shape to different pieces of the puzzle. Here at last is a book that provides the integrative framework within which these pieces can fit together.Why is it so difficult for people to change? What can be done to maximize the chances for success? To answer these questions, this sweeping book travels across a vast intellectual terrain, encompassing the history of ideas about human nature, developments in the cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, evolution, psychobiology, developmental psychology, theories of emotion, the psychology of self, and more. The author then applies the theory to practice, drawing on his wide personal experience with hundreds of clients &#x201d;in transition&#x201d; to outline a model of significant change. Mahoney identifies common themes and experience patterns associated with dramatic change, emphasizing the role of emotionality and cognitive processes, and challenging long-revered notions about thinking and feeling.Here is an important work that will point researchers in new directions, will help practicing therapists adapt theoretical concepts to helping patients change, and will make fascinating reading for anyone exploring his or her own life journey.</p><p><b>Michael J.

On a good night Appo made as much as a skilled laborer made in a year. Bad nights left him with more than a dozen scars and over a decade in prisons from the Tombs and Sing Sing to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where he reunited with another inmate, his father. The child of Irish and Chinese immigrants, Appo grew up in the notorious Five Points and Chinatown neighborhoods. He rose as an exemplar of the "good fellow," a criminal who relied on wile, who followed a code of loyalty even in his world of deception. Here is the underworld of the New York that gave us Edith Wharton, Boss Tweed, Central Park, and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p> 60 illustrations</p><p>Timothy J. Gilfoyle is an acclaimed historian. His first book, City of Eros, won the prestigious Nevins Prize, awarded by the Society of American Historians. He is professor of history at Loyola University in Chicago.George Appo was a strange yet far from unappealing man. The son of a Chinese father and an Irish mother, he was "diminutive" and "slight." He had no education and was utterly out of place in polite society, yet in his way he was a success: "A pickpocket, confidence man, and opium addict, he lived off his criminal activities during his teenage years and much of his adult life. On successful nights during the 1870s and 1880s, he earned in excess of six hundred dollars pilfering the pockets of those around him, equivalent to the annual salary of a skilled manual laborer." Before finally going straight, he also made a bundle off a scam known as the "green goods game," which lured unsuspecting provincial rubes to New York, where they were swiftly and efficiently taken to the cleaners. <p>Appo was pretty much forgotten well before his death in 1930 at the age of 73 and would be completely forgotten now except for one genuine oddity: Late in his life, he wrote a memoir. It was never published, its literary style is most charitably described as primitive, and it's far from clear why he wrote it in the first place. But the typewritten manuscript, 99 pages in length, was obtained by the Society for the Prevention of Crime, which had been instrumental in Appo's rehabilitation, and in time it found its way to Columbia University. It is the foundation upon which Timothy J. Gilfoyle has constructed this account of Appo's life and times, one that provides an instructive and somewhat chilling depiction of life in New York's underside during the late 19th century. </p><p>Gilfoyle, who teaches history at Loyola University in Chicago, in 1988 was given the Allan Nevins Prize by the Society of American Historians "for the best-written doctoral dissertation on an American subject." Four years later, it was published by Norton as City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution, and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920. Like many other contemporary American historians, Gilfoyle knows that the great-man theory of history tells only part of the story, that the way ordinary people lived unnoticed lives can tell us as much, if not more, about their times as the doings of statesmen, generals and tycoons. He also knows that the past isn't pretty, that crime and antisocial behavior were parts of the story that can't be ignored. </p><p>New York in the post-Civil War decades was a sinkhole of crime. The above-ground economy couldn't accommodate all those who swarmed into the city, native-born and immigrants alike, and by no means were all of them prepared to take their places in that economy even if it had work for them. Crammed into fetid tenements, consuming inadequate diets, deprived of any meaningful health care, uncountable thousands of New Yorkers, both new and old, were drawn into crime simply to survive. This was especially true of boys, who were thrown into the streets early and quickly learned pickpocketing and other shady trades. "Lacking formal education, adult supervision, and sometimes even a home," Gilfoyle writes, "youths like Appo were derided as 'gamins,' 'Arabs,' 'urchins,' 'gutter-snipes,' and 'street rats.' For more than half a century they were inescapable fixtures of the nineteenth-century industrial city. . . . They lived, slept, and ate in streets, alleys, and hallways. Their precise number was always subject to debate, but few doubted that it was substantial." </p><p>Pickpocketing was commonplace, almost pandemic. Lower Broadway was "pickpockets' paradise," and most of those picking pockets were boys: In the quarter-century after 1859, 80 percent of those tried for the crime "were between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, native-born, and male," Gilfoyle writes. </p><p>"The precise dimensions of the pickpocket's world remain impossible to measure. Purloined goods were rarely recovered, and even smaller proportions of pickpockets were ever prosecuted. In the seventeen known years in which George Appo worked as a pickpocket, for example, he was arrested for and convicted of larceny four times. To the average law-abiding citizen, four convictions were considerable. But Appo picked hundreds -- quite possibly thousands -- of pockets without being apprehended. Once, while working a county fair outside Toronto, Appo pickpocketed approximately twenty-five different individuals. His four arrests for pickpocketing quite likely account for less -- maybe much less -- than 1 percent of all his thefts." </p><p>This isn't to say that Appo spent no time in custody. He did a lot of time, and it had crucial effects on his life, behavior and outlook. By the time he was in his late twenties, he "had encountered an astonishing diversity of incarcerations," including "a year of juvenile reform on the school ship Mercury, three sentences in the workshops of Sing Sing," and various other stretches ranging from a year in solitary to a few weeks in jail. Sing Sing was the worst: "Throughout his memoir Appo repeatedly charged that prison life and the cruelty of guards in Sing Sing drove many to insanity, death, and suicide." Whether his own mental faculties were affected by his time there is not clear, but he said it left him "injured for life." </p><p>It was after his release from a penitentiary in Pennsylvania in 1887 that Appo became a "con artist, a trickster extraordinaire," in the "green goods game." It was run by operators who sent letters around the country "claiming that they possessed stolen or discarded currency engraving plates from the U.S. Treasury. The circular offered genuine-looking counterfeit money, or 'green goods,' to prospective buyers at cut-rate prices." Buyers "were instructed to travel to certain hotels in the New York metropolitan region," where "they were met by a 'bunco steerer' like Appo who, after an exchange of passwords, 'steered' the individual to a 'turning joint' in another hotel or office." The sucker ended up with a satchel full of anything except money: "Bamboozled, humiliated, and empty handed, victims had no legal recourse, for they themselves were guilty of attempting to defraud the federal government." </p><p>Eventually the scam was investigated by a special committee of the New York state Senate, before which Appo "discussed various elements of the green goods game." He also provided "revelations of police complicity," perhaps the most important evidence he gave because it underscored the depth and breadth of the game. For his troubles, he became a marked man, among crooks and cops alike, and was assaulted at least six times. He briefly became a celebrity of sorts and played himself in a melodramatic play about the green goods game, but he was "depressed and terrified," and in 1896 he was sent to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, but was released about a year later. </p><p>After his return, his life changed. "Laying in an opium joint," as he wrote in his memoir, he "began to think what a fool I was to go back to the opium pipe after being away from it for so long." That led him to wonder: "If I could break away so easily and so often as I had from the opium habit, why not muster up nerve enough to break away from a crooked life? I made up my mind to try again to get honest employment and to reform without fear or favor." Thanks largely to people at the Society for the Prevention of Crime, he did just that. He worked in various menial jobs, almost always was hard up, but he stayed straight right up to his death. </p><p>One of his most important friends at SPC, Frank Moss, "concluded that a formal education and better environmental influences could have enabled Appo to become 'an intelligent and estimable person.' " Certainly he had the makings of a decent man and a solid citizen. His story, rescued by Gilfoyle from the dustbin of history, is a reminder that criminals are made as well as born and that the child is indeed father to the man. Ignored and miserable as a small boy, Appo was thrown out onto the street and left to make what he could of himself. That he chose crime should come as no surprise; what is surprising is that he finally renounced it and tried to make himself into the man he could -- and should -- have been from the beginning. </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

For others, translation is the royal road to cross-cultural understanding and literary enrichment. In this nuanced and provocative study, Mark Polizzotti attempts to reframe the debate along more fruitful lines. Eschewing both these easy polarities and the increasingly abstract discourse of translation theory, he brings the main questions into clearer focus: What is the ultimate goal of a translation? What does it mean to label a rendering &#x201c;faithful&#x201d;? (Faithful to what?) Is something inevitably lost in translation, and can something also be gained? <i>Does</i> translation matter, and if so, why? Unashamedly opinionated, both a manual and a manifesto, his book invites usto sympathize with the translator not as a &#x201c;traitor&#x201d; but as the author's creative partner.</p><p>Polizzotti, himself a translator of authors from Patrick Modiano to Gustave Flaubert, explores what translation is and what it isn't, and how it does or doesn't work. Translation, he writes, &#x201c;skirts the boundaries between art and craft, originality and replication, altruism and commerce, genius and hack work.&#x201d; In <i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i>, he shows us how to read not only translations but also the act of translation itself, treating it not as a problem to be solved but as an achievement to be celebrated&#x2015;something, as Goethe put it, &#x201c;impossible, necessary, and important.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Mark Polizzotti has translated more than fifty books, including works by Patrick Modiano, Gustave Flaubert, Raymond Roussel, Marguerite Duras, and Paul Virilio. Publisher and Editor-in-Chief at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he is also the author of <i>Revolution of the Mind: The Life of Andr� Breton </i>and other books.<p><i>Sympathy for the Traitor</i> is a swift, lucid, and engaging tour of what translation is and does. Polizzotti reviews two thousand years of thought on the subject, sweeps away contorted academic theorizing, and makes an unbreakable case for sympathetic readability. And then, acknowledging the many peculiarities of the mind-meld that is translation, he goes on to visit the farther reaches of translingual exploration. This little book deserves to become a standard text.</p>&#x2015;<b>Luc Sante</b>, author of <i>The Other Paris</i>; translator of F�lix F�n�on's <i>Novels in Three Lines</i><br><br><p>Translation is the most delicate art, a form of mimetic magic invisible to many, taken for granted by readers who would be lost without it. Mark Polizzotti's book makes the hazards and thorny choices involved in translation vividly evident, but goes much further, into questions of enduring perplexity that arise from the interface of cultures, the homogenization of life in a shrinking world, and the effort to preserve difference while facilitating understanding. A beautifully written, necessary book, and a timely one.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gary Indiana</b>, author of <i>I Can Give You Anything But Love</i> and <i>Do Everything in the Dark</i></p><h2>Like Life: Sculpture, Color, and the Body</h2><p><b>Explores how artists from the European Renaissance to the global present have used sculpture and color to evoke the presence of the living body&nbsp;</b><br><br> Since the earliest myths of the sculptor Pygmalion bringing a statue to life through desire, artists have explored the boundaries between sculpture and the physical materiality of the body. This groundbreaking volume examines key sculptural works from 13th-century Europe to the global present, revealing new insights into the strategies artists deploy to blur the distinction between art and life. Sculpture, which has historically taken the human figure as its subject, is presented here in myriad manifestations created by artists ranging from Donatello and Degas to Picasso, Kiki Smith, and Jeff Koons. Featuring works created in traditional media such as wood and marble as well as the unexpected such as wax, metal, and blood, <i>Like Life</i> presents sculpture&nbsp;both conventional and shocking, including effigies, dolls, mannequins, automata, waxworks, and anatomical models. Containing&nbsp;texts by art and cultural historians as well as interviews with contemporary artists, this is a provocative exploration of three-dimensional representations of the human body.</p><p>In an expansive survey of sculpture over six centuries of creative activity, this book delves into the ways that artists used sculpture and color to evoke the presence of the living body.<br> &nbsp;<b>Luke Syson</b> is Iris and B.

Oliver Twist's famous cry of the heart has resounded with readers since the novel's initial appearance in 1837, and the book remains a popular favorite with fans of all ages.<br>Dickens was no stranger to the pain of hunger and the degradation of poverty. He poured his own youthful experience of Victorian London's unspeakable squalor into this realistic depiction of the link between destitution and crime. Oliver escapes his miserable servitude by running away to London, where he unwillingly but inevitably joins a scabrous gang of thieves. Masterminded by the loathsome Fagin, the underworld crew features some of Dickens' most memorable characters, including the juvenile pickpocket known as the Artful Dodger, the vicious Bill Sikes, and gentle Nancy, an angel of self-sacrifice.<br>A profound social critic, Dickens introduced genteel readers to the problems of the poor in a way that had rarely been attempted before.

Inner Eurasia, as the author defines it, comprises most of the former Soviet Union and Russia's huge territories in Siberia; Russia's former empire in Central Asia; China's central Asian empire; and Mongolia, both the parts within China and those within the Mongolian People's Republic. The author presents Inner Eurasia as a coherent region with an underlying unity in geography and history despite its cultural and ecological variety.<br> <p>This volume, the first of two surveying this region, charts developments from the Old Stone Age, through changes under such peoples as the Scythians, the Huns and the Turks, to the emergence of an identifiable "Rus" - the society from which modern Russia and Ukraine have evolved. The book sets political events in the broadest context of social and economic change, linking evolution to the vast geography of the territories it describes. Together with volume II covering the period up to the present, the work represents the most thorough, up-to-date study of this fascinating and much misunderstood region of the world.</p><b>David Christian</b> is an Associate Professor in the Department of History at Macquarie University, Sydney where he has taught since 1975.

His other publications include&nbsp;editions of the plays&nbsp;of John Ford and the poems of John Cleveland.&nbsp; Morris&#x2019;s introduction begins with a discussion of the text as it first appeared in the First Folio of 1623. In the next section, he analyzes the problematic relationship between <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> and <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i>, a different play which first appeared in text 29 years before the First Folio, and whose virtually identical name has caused much confusion. Morris then considers the date, sources, and authorship of the play, addressing the question of whether Shakespeare himself wrote it. In the last and most substantial part of the introduction, the editor examines the play&#x2019;s structures, themes (such as education, love, and marriage), and afterlife. Three appendices follow the text of the play: evidence to establish the relationship of <i>The Shrew</i> and <i>A Shrew</i>, from Samuel Hickson; the Sly scenes in <i>A Shrew</i>; and a source (from Gascoigne&#x2019;s <i>Supposes</i>)<i> </i>and analogues.<br><br><b>The Arden Shakespeare</b> has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play&#x2019;s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise&nbsp;to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.</p><p>This is a new edition of an anonymous play which appears to be an alternative version of Shakespeare&#39;s popular comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Stephen Miller suggests that someone rewrote Shakespeare&#39;s more complicated version, making it shorter, simpler and different in some ways. The main difference between the two plays concerns the framing story of Christopher Sly, the drunk, who disappears early on in Shakespeare&#39;s version, but who has a much larger role in A Shrew.This edition provides a modernised text and extensive commentary.An exciting new edition of the complete works of Shakespeare with these features: Illustrated with photographs from New York Shakespeare Festival productions, vivid readable readable introductions for each play by noted scholar David Bevington, a lively personal foreword by Joseph Papp, an insightful essay on the play in performance, modern spelling and pronunciation, up-to-date annotated bibliographies, and convenient listing of key passages.</p><h2>CEB Deep Blue Kids Bible: Common English Bible</h2><p>Kids will dive deep into God&#x2019;s word with the CEB Deep Blue Kids Bible.

The Lord desires to pour out His Blessings on your land, but scripture says that His blessings can be blocked. The Lord, as the owner of the original &#34;Title Deed&#34; gave us the responsibility to &#34;subdue, and take &#34;dominion&#34; over the land we are appointed to. Acts 17:26. The word establishes the spiritual relationship between God, and His land. The word also reveals to us how previous events that took place on the land by ourselves, our ancestors, former owners, or inhabitants of the land can cast a &#34;cloud on the title&#34; of the land. Land most certainly has a heritage. Many communities have erected memorials to commemorate what happened many years ago on some historical property site. When you inherit or purchase or rent property, the heritage comes with it. Like the buildings that you may see on top of it, there are hidden structures in place under it. What is beneath can be causing problems for what, or who is above. The Lord has called each of us to be Ambassadors of Reconciliation on behalf of our land, according to II Chron.7: 14. This book guides you through the scriptural steps to reconcile and redeem your land, so the blessings of the Lord can flow freely with no limitations. Included are step-by-step instructions with scriptures to decree, and prayers to pray, as you share communion with your land. There is a new spiritual &#34;Title Deed&#34; that will serve as a written declaration that your property has been redeemed and is free and clear of any spiritual demonic liens, also called curses. The practical applications of the information contained in this book will form a powerful combination that will inspire you to action, and will enable you to set your land free of any curses. Don&#39;t live another day under any &#34;cloud of guilt&#34;, that may be encompassing your property, and you. Call on the name that is above all names to save us from any sin, and live in the freedom and prosperity that He promised us.</p><p>Jeanette Strauss is an Ordained Minister through Gospel Crusade, Bradenton Florida.

In July of this year, we were in the middle of a drought on our land. It was at the point that if we did not receive rain soon, we would lose most of our crop. Our corn had already tasseled out and it is critical for the rains to come during that time to help pollinate the corn. Our soybeans were knee high and were blossoming and the blossoms were falling off and very few bean pods were developing. I asked the Lord to show me what to do. As I prayed that day in mid July, he put it in my heart that we needed to bless our land. I had received a book from a friend of mine back in April called From God s Hands to Your Land by Jeanette Strauss. I found the book and sat down and read it through that afternoon. I then told my husband when he came home that the Lord had showed me that we needed to bless our land. I explained to him that there was a procedure that we needed to follow and that this book would take us step by step through it. On July 17, 2012, we went through the ceremony of blessing our land and giving our land back to God. On the 19th of July the rains came. By the 27th of July we had 7 1/2 inches of rain on our land. New blossoms sprouted on our soybeans. My husband is 6 feet tall and in August when he would be out walking in the fields the beans were up to his chest. They grew abundantly. God has richly blessed us. In a drought year our land has produced a record crop of soybeans. Our land has on average produced 35-40 bushels of soybeans an acre. This year we have harvested 55-60 bushels to the acre. Our corn fields typically produce 150 bushels to the acre. My husband was hoping for 100 bushels this year and would have been very satisfied with that due to the drought. . Our corn fields this year averaged 157 bushels to the acre. The richest blessing has not come from what our fields have yielded this year but rather for what God has done in our hearts. He has showed us His faithfulness to His promises. Our faith has grown immeasurably. When we were obedient to what God showed us to do, we didn t know how things would turn out. From the moment that we stepped out in obedience, we had to walk by faith that God would take care of us. It was now His land and we were just the caretakers of it. We had to make sure that we spoke only positive things out of our mouth concerning the land. This summer we learned to walk by faith and not by sight and God has richly blessed us. Al &amp; Betty Tanner Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. --Al &amp; Betty Tanner - West Unity, Ohio<br><br>My husband and I took the advice from this book and followed the steps of the Blessings ceremony on our fields of beans and corn. This year a drought came and we were losing everything. I went down to the fields and walked around reminding the Lord that these fields were His, and thanking him for preserving the crops even in the time of drought for His Glory. I am so happy to report that this field had a higher yield per acre then last year. A High Praise to God. He is so Good and Rick and I are so proud to be the caretakers of His land. --Rick and Mary</p><h2>Emily&#39;s Quest (Emily Novels)</h2><p>The third and final volume of Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x2019;s celebrated Emily trilogy, <i>Emily&#x2019;s Quest</i> is a vigorously drawn study of a woman coming to terms with love and her own ambition.

Many of these teachers are going to countries that are not very receptive to other forms of Western Christian mission. Some Western Christians view English teaching primarily as a means to gain access to "closed" countries for the purpose of evangelistic outreach. Other Western Christians see it mainly as a form of social service.

How apt that a chef who prepares such dazzling Mexican food should lead us through Oaxaca. The soul and lore of this magical place will add new life to your table through Zarela's recipes."<br>--Shelia Lukins, author of USA Cookbook, Food Editor of Parade Magazine<br><br>"Food in Mexico, especially in Oaxaca, smacks of so much more than trends and nutrition. Zarela Martinez knows this passionately and has bestowed on us a book that will enrich the lives of all that are really hungry, all that are seeking more than the latest flavor. Filled with honest glimpses of an extraordinary place, The Food and Life of Oaxaca offers the most intimate understanding anyone can gain of another culture--the understanding that comes through flavor. For many in Oaxaca, eating is the perfect act of celebration, consecrating every aspect of life. The warm flavors Zarela Martinez has captured here are the perfect expression of Oaxaca's generous spirit."<br>--Rick Bayless, author of Authentic Mexican and Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen Visit us online at: www.mcp.com/mgr</p><p><i>The Food and Life of Oaxaca</i>, by New York restaurateur Zarela Martinez, is a fascinating cultural study disguised as a great cookbook. Martinez is part of the new renaissance of Mexican food writers and chefs, including <i>Rick Bayless</i> and Diana Kennedy, who reaffirm that culinary awareness goes hand in hand with cultural awareness.<p>In fact, Martinez, a Mexican, credits her time in Oaxaca as "redefining my whole understanding of Mexico." Oaxaca is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse regions in Mexico, echoed throughout <i>The Food and Life of Oaxaca</i> in both the recipes and the accompanying essays. Martinez adamantly insists that to cook a dish, you must first understand it. She provides not only the how-to of a recipe, but also the why. In the chapter on <i>moles</i>, she provides seven outstanding recipes and explains beautifully why the sauces predominate Oaxacan cuisine. Her section on tamales is simply one of the best available, providing solid instruction and Oaxacan variations of the traditional Mexican party food. Chefs new to Mexican cuisine will find the glossary of ingredients indispensable. And any chef will find Martinez's passion for her subject inspiring.<i>--Mark O. Howerton</i></p>Deep in southern Mexico lies a magical place&#x2014;a land of dramatic beauty, proud heritage, and food that some aficionados consider Mexico's best. The state of Oaxaca is a tapestry of many cultures still close to their pre-Hispanic roots. The rugged mountain ranges pocket the ancient languages, traditions, and foodways of the many different peoples who lived here even before the Aztecs, in the great days of the Zapotec Empire. In this very special collection of recipes and memories, author Zarela Mart�nez shares her love of The Food and Life of Oaxaca. Oaxaca is the most biologically and culturally diverse state of all Mexico. A proud village life still recalls the heroic resistance that the native peoples put up against the Spanish conquerors. The glorious state capital, Oaxaca City, offers a rich fusion of the Spanish and Indian (especially Zapotec) legacies, and sits in a valley where all good things grow abundantly, from wheat and apples to walnuts and cabbages. Other areas produce delicious tropical fruits; from the Pacific coast come fish and shellfish. All parts of Oaxaca grow a profusion of wonderful chile varieties used with bold subtlety throughout the region and special strains of corn that surpass even the usual excellence of Mexican corn. Created from this bounty are dishes that come from the hearts and souls of the Oaxacan people. The regional cuisine is inextricably tied to the days of the religious calendar and the deep communal life of the villages. The Food and Life of Oaxaca captures this interrelationship through traditional recipes from the major church celebrations &#x2014; the most colorful being the Days of the Dead on November 1 and 2 &#x2014; as well as through simple everyday dishes. Zarela shares the authentic tastes of Wedding Stew (a savory, Spanish-influenced braised chicken dish with pickled chiles), Gaspacho (a shredded meat salad, not a soup!), Potato-Cheese Fritters, and many of the state's famous tamales. In a richly detailed chapter, Zarela unlocks the secrets of the renowned regional moles &#x2014; those sublime main-dish sauces that have earned Oaxaca the fond nickname "The Land of the Seven Moles." And what real chocolate-lover could resist the thrill of grinding chocolate from the actual beans? From the full-bodied and extravagant flavors of the major cities' most illustrious dishes to recipes from small villages, market stalls, and street peddlers, The Food and Life of Oaxaca explores the difference and delights of Oaxacan cooking. Even cooks already passionate about Mexican food will discover whole new worlds of flavors and techniques, some dating back to before the Conquest. Complementing the recipes, Laurie Smith's sensitive black and white photographs reveal the dignity and vitality of the Oaxacan people. The Food and Life of Oaxaca captures the vibrant spirit and lasting traditions that are leading more and more travelers to this alluring region of Mexico.</p><h2>HIST, Volume 2 (with HIST Online, 1 term (6 months) Printed Access Card) (New, Engaging Titles from 4LTR Press)</h2><p>Learn American history YOUR Way with HIST!

How did 19th-century Europeans turn mountains of bird excrement from Peru into mountains of gold? Where has most of the world&#39;s oil come from in the 20th century? This new edition of &#34;The World That Trade Created&#34; reveals the answers to dozens of tantalizing questions like these. In a series of brief, highly readable vignettes the authors bring to life international trade and its actors - including migrants and merchants, pirates and privateers, sailors and slaves, traders and tree-tappers. In the process they make clear that the seemingly modern concept of economic globalization has deep historical roots. The authors also demonstrate that economic activity cannot be divorced from social and cultural contexts. This second edition provides enhanced coverage of Africa, the Middle East, and the 20th century, and features eighteen new vignettes, including two new pieces on oil.</p><p></p><h2>Printmaking: History and Process</h2><p>A basic text that discusses techniques and applications in every major area of printmaking.

In addition, this new edition contains a number of case histories for use in problem-based learning (PBL) along with suggested answers, thus making it even more useful in the classroom.</p><p>I compiled this book partly to help a friend of mine who was in Chinese medicine/acupuncture school. Talking with my friend, it was clear that there was a need for a book which A) included all the patterns of Chinese medicine, not just the best known ones, and B) which explained how these patterns actually manifest in real-life Western patients. Most Western patients exhibit the signs and symptoms of 35 patterns concurrently. When this happens, the disease mechanisms underlying these different patterns alter the signs and symptoms from those given in most beginner&#39;s textbooks. For instance, when cold and heat exist simultaneously, the tongue and pulse will typically only exhibit the signs of heat, while one must infer the presence of cold from other indicators.This book is a practical compendium of TCM patterns with their disease causes and mechanisms, signs and symptoms, treatment principles, guiding formulas, main modifications, and acupuncture treatments.

During his thirty-four-year tenure, Justice Stevens was a prolific writer, authoring more than 1000 opinions. In THE MAKING OF A JUSTICE, John Paul Stevens recounts his extraordinary life, offering an intimate and illuminating account of his service on the nation's highest court. <br>Appointed by President Gerald Ford and eventually retiring during President Obama's first term, Justice Stevens has been witness to, and an integral part of, landmark changes in American society. <br><br>With stories of growing up in Chicago, his work as a naval traffic analyst at Pearl Harbor during World War II, and his early days in private practice, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most important Supreme Court decisions over the last four decades, THE MAKING OF A JUSTICE offers a warm and fascinating account of Justice Stevens' unique and transformative American life.This comprehensive memoir is a must read for those trying to better understand our country.</p><p>Justice John Paul Stevens served on U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 until his retirement in 2010. He is the third-longest serving Justice in American history. Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1920, Stevens served in the United States Navy during World War II and graduated from Northwestern University School of Law. He was appointed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 1970 by President Richard Nixon and to the Supreme Court in 1975 by Gerald Ford. He was the author of two other books, <i>Five Chiefs </i>and <i>Six Amendments</i>. Justice Stevens passed away in 2019."Stevens delivers...on a handful of timely and hugely important themes, starting with the shape of American democracy...his defense crackles with spirit."&#x2015;<b><i>Emily Bazelon, <em>New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"Studded with cameos by boldface names...The new book lays out his philosophy through example, through cases and events that influenced his thinking."&#x2015;<b><i>Jess Bravin, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"A compelling look back at a fascinating life and career."&#x2015;<b><i>Mackenzie Dawson, <em>New York Post</em><br><br> </i></b><br><br>"Provides much food for thought for law students, lawyers and those interested in the legal underpinning of our present national mess."&#x2015;<b><i>Neil Steinberg,<em> Chicago Sun Times </em></i></b><br><br>"The inspiring legacy of Justice John Paul Stevens-including both the brilliance of his mind and the humaneness of his character-are well represented in his last book, <i>The Making of a Justice</i>." <b></b>&#x2015;<b><i><i>New York Review of Books</i></i></b><br><br>"The memoir is a tale of a privileged childhood in Chicago, the ravages of the Great Depression and a family scandal, service as a wartime cryptologist and a charmed legal career as a Supreme Court clerk, appeals court judge and the third-longest-serving justice in the court's history."&#x2015;<b><i>Robert Barnes, <em>The Washington Post</em></i></b><br><br>"To be 99 years old and still writing, in itself, merits acclaim.

Tour.</p><p>Christopher Andersen's biography <i>Jackie After Jack: Portrait of the Lady</i> is one steamy read. Andersen claims that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had affairs with Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, William Holden, Warren Beatty, Bobby Kennedy, and JFK's former deputy secretary of defense. He writes that she battled anorexia, was both cheap and greedy, wore big sunglasses partly to cover up bruises inflicted by Aristotle Onassis, tried to sign Princess Diana to a book contract, offered Camilla Parker Bowles $2 million to tell all, and dropped Michael Jackson, whose book she edited, when he stood accused of pederasty. Andersen suggests that the cancer that killed Jackie may have been related to her habits: 40 to 60 cigarettes a day, four decades of carcinogenic black hair dye, and countless amphetamine and carcinogenic steroid injections in the 1960s. Many of the juiciest stories come from anonymous sources, and, according to <i>Newsweek</i>, Brando's biographer claims the alleged Jackie tryst never happened. Some readers may feel that Andersen's breezy assertion that Castro murdered JFK may not fully settle the question. But many will want to check out what ex-<i>People</i> magazine writer Andersen has to say. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Christopher Andersen is the critically acclaimed author of 17 books, which have been translated into more than 20 languages worldwide.

The core of it first appeared in Questions and Politeness, edited by Esther N. Goody (now out of print). It is here reissued with a fresh introduction that surveys the considerable literature in linguistics, psychology and the social sciences that the original extended essay stimulated, and suggests distinct directions for research. The authors describe and account for some remarkable parallelisms in the linguistic construction of utterances with which people express themselves in different languages and cultures. A motive for these parallels is isolated and a universal model is constructed outlining the abstract principles underlying polite usages. This is based on the detailed study of three unrelated languages and cultures: the Tamil of South India, the Tzeltal spoken by Mayan Indians in Chiapas, Mexico, and the English of the USA and England. This volume will be of special interest to students in linguistic pragmatics, sociolinguistics, applied linguistics, anthropology, and the sociology and social psychology of interaction.</p><p>A new introduction surveys the considerable literature in linguistics, psychology and social sciences that the original essay on the phenomenon of politeness stimulated.This study is about the principles for constructing polite speech.</p><h2>Loose Leaf for General, Organic, &amp; Biological Chemistry</h2><p>This text is different--by design.

Barry's <b>ENGLISH GRAMMAR</b> makes students feel that they are active participants in shaping their language rather than passive victims of grammar rules that someone imposes on them. </p> <p> Each chapter contains three kinds of exercises to help students master English grammar: </p> <ul> <li>Discussion Exercises are distributed throughout the chapter and designed for group or class work.</li> <li>Reflections are open-ended questions and project suggestions at the end of each chapter.</li> <li>Practice Exercises at the end of each chapter integrate all the information presented in that chapter.</li> </ul><p> This book is written for students of English grammar, who come to the task of studying the language with a variety of skills, interests, goals, and expectations, not to mention fears and anxieties. It is addressed primarily to the native speaker of English, and so it is not designed to teach English. Rather, it builds on what students already know to develop an appreciation for how the language works. </p> <p> The main focus of the book is on language as human behavior. Students are encouraged to view English not as an abstract system of rules, but as an instrument of people who seek patterns and regularity, who use language to communicate their needs and wishes and to exercise power over others, and who are capable of experiencing linguistic insecurity in the face of social judgments about their usage. Students also come to learn that the language they use is the result of people's use over a long period of time, not just a tool for the present, and that English, along with judgments about particular usage, shifts over time. The goal of the book is to make students feel that they are active participants in shaping their language rather than passive victims of grammar rules that someone imposes on them. They are encouraged to be curious about how others use English, and to be flexible enough to understand that there are competing descriptions of language structure, as well as competing opinions about correctness. </p> <p> In its discussion of English, the book largely adheres to traditional grammatical terminology to keep continuity with our long and rich heritage of grammar studies. At the same time, the grammatical descriptions are informed by the insights gained from modern linguistic analysis. The merger of these two approaches gives students the necessary tools to think about how their language works without becoming entrenched in the mindset of a particular theory. It also provides them with the flexibility to adapt to new terminology they might encounter elsewhere. Lastly, in keeping with the main goal of talking about human behavior, discussion turns to usage and usage questions wherever they are relevant. </p> <p> The book is designed for a one-semester college course. It covert the basics of English without dwelling on the exceptional or the exotic. It begins with a discussion of the development of a standard English language and the origins of our present day rules of English and attitudes towards usage. Students are invited to explore their own recognition of standard English and to appreciate that people may differ in their judgments. They learn that what is considered "correct" does not always match what sounds appropriate to them. The first chapter lays the foundation for the study of grammar, emphasizing the complex interaction between language rules and behavior. The second chapter talks about how one approaches the study of the structure of a language, including a brief discussion of how languages change over time. It also gives an overview of language structure, explaining the essentially hierarchical as opposed to linear nature of language. From there the book works from the lowest levels of grammatical organization to the highest, starting with an analysis of words and working up to the level of the sentence. </p> <p> As students and teachers begin to work with this book, they will realize that the material is integrated in ways not apparent from the chapter headings. There is no part of language that is wholly separate from the other parts: it is an organic system in which the parts are interrelated and function together to perform the highly complex task of communicating human thought. Naturally, then, a description of a language cannot consist of wholly separate parts either. In this particular description, there is a good deal of recycling of information. Topics are not necessarily explored in their entirety when they are first introduced and may resurface in other contexts to have new light shed on them. In some cases a theme is introduced early and developed gradually throughout the book. The most commonly recurring themes have to do with the factors that influence people's use of their language: their common needs and preferences, and their shared strategies for turning their thoughts into words. </p> <p> Each chapter contains three types of exercises. First, there are short <i>Discussion Exercises</i> distributed throughout the chapter and designed for group or class work. These typically exemplify and reinforce a newly introduced principle. They give students a chance to check their own understanding in a non-threatening forum and to spend part of every class period talking about language. On occasion these exercises are used to encourage students to extend what they have learned and to uncover new facts and principles of grammar themselves. In this way, the exercises become an integral part of the text material and serve a teaching as well as a review function. The Instructor's Manual provides additional discussion of these exercises, which may be shared with students to the extent that the instructor finds it relevant and useful. </p> <p> Second, there are open-ended questions and project suggestions at the end of each chapter, called <b>Reflections.</b> These are intended to get students to think about language use&#x2014;their own and others'&#x2014;in real-life settings or to ponder some aspect of English structure that eludes analysis. These exercises are intended to stimulate further class discussion and engage students in timely, enjoyable discourse about their language. </p> <p> Finally, there are <b>Practice Exercises</b> at the end of each chapter that integrate all the information presented in that chapter. These are designed for students to work on outside of class. They are intended to be more closed-ended than the other exercise types, and they focus on purely structural material rather than on questions of usage. Answer guides to these exercises are provided at the end of the book. Of course, given the nature of language, these also often lend themselves to discussion. </p> <p> The exercises taken together are designed to get students to think, talk, and write about English with increasing confidence and sophistication as the term progresses. </p> <p> As anyone who has ever tried it knows, describing a language is an open-ended enterprise. There is always more that could be said. The goal here is to lay the necessary groundwork for thinking about language so that students can extend what they learn to new situations when the occasion arises, and to apply their knowledge in ways most useful to them, either in teaching the language to others or in their own speaking and writing, or in making sense of the often subtle but always pervasive set of social judgments that accompany language use. This book is a conversation about English that approaches grammar as a process, not a product; and it is a book in which thoughtful explanations are valued over "correct" answers. Above all, it strives to stimulate excitement, enthusiasm, and wonder about English usage that will endure once the course is over. </p> <p><b>NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION</b></p> <p> In response to the thoughtful and insightful comments of students, colleagues, and reviewers, I have made certain changes in this edition. Most of these changes involve reorganization and the addition of exercises. The final chapter of the first edition has been omitted entirely, and the material on ambiguity and coordination, originally Chapter 8, has been integrated into other chapters. Clause coordination and clause subordination are treated in chapters of their own. I have tried to respond to the "save the trees" debate by scaling back but not eliminating entirely the use of tree diagrams for illustrating sentence structure. </p> <p> A minor change in the exercises is that answers are provided for every <i>other</i> question in the Practice Exercises, rather than for every question. This should be enough for students to gauge their level of understanding without creating undue dependence on the answers, and it is hoped that missing answers will serve to integrate these exercises into classroom discussions. The remaining answers can be found in the Instructor's Manual. </p> <p> A more serious concern about the exercises in the first edition was that they did not give students a chance to examine language in its natural context, exactly what they would ultimately be doing when applying their grammatical knowledge. With that concern in mind, I have added two additional types of exercises at the end of every chapter. The first provides an excerpt of literary prose (from Charles Baxter's collection <i>Believers: A Novella and Stories,</i> Pantheon Books: New York, 1997) and asks students to identify grammatical structures within the selection. The second is a series of letters written by a fictitious person (me!) that exhibit many of the typical nonstandard features of written English, and students are asked to identify them. The added advantage of both new exercise types is that they are a comprehensive and prompt ongoing review of past material. </p> <p> With the second edition, students also have the advantage of an extensive online Study Guide, which reviews basic concepts and provides a wide variety of practice exercises with answers for the material of each chapter. The Study Guide appears on Prentice Hall's companion website and provides automatic scoring of the exercises. It is also available for download for students who prefer a regular print format. </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p> <p> I have referred to this book as "a conversation about English." More accurately, it is a contribution to a conversation that has been taking place for hundreds of years among grammarians, linguists, English teachers, dictionary makers, and self-appointed guardians of the English language. This larger conversation is not an orderly one. There are differences of opinion and differences of approach, some minor and some major. Nevertheless, this collective thinking about the English language provides a rich and lively context in which to do one's own exploration.

Does he or she want to be a positive Christian influence in the world through fiction? Sharon Watson, author of Apologia Press&#39;s popular middle school writing curriculum JUMP IN, offers Writing Fiction [in High School], an exciting, new textbook specially designed for your homeschool, private school, or Christian teen. Writing Fiction [in High School] is written to the student in a conversational tone and requires only minimal parental/teacher guidance. It&#39;s packed with literally hundreds of age-appropriate, real-fiction examples from classics, best-sellers, and movies so students can learn how to write their own intriguing short stories or novels. Your students will study and practice essential elements of storywriting and learn to critique their own work and classmates&#39;, too. In addition, they&#39;ll discuss important ideas about fiction in their groups formed from class members, co-op classes, or friends. Writing Fiction [in High School] refers to The Last Book in the Universe by Rodman Philbrick (sold separately) in many of its chapters. Sharon Watson recommends buying that book and using it with the textbook. That way, students can more easily see how a complete novel and its elements work as they discuss characters, characterization, setting, meaningful discriptions, dialogue, voice, plot, scenes, conflict, the hero&#39;s journey, and much, much more.

A vast array of scholars contributed to the large, developing complex of ideas and trends that now serves as the foundation of contemporary discussions on interpretation. In A Brief History of Old Testament Criticism, Mark Gignilliat brings representative figures&#x2014;such as Baruch Spinoza, W.M.L. de Wette, Julius Wellhausen, Hermann Gunkel, and others&#x2014;and their theories together to serve as windows into the critical trends of Old Testament interpretation in the modern period. This concise overview is ideal for classroom use. It lays a foundation and provides a working knowledge of the major critical interpreters of the Old Testament, their approaches to the Bible, and the philosophical background of their positions. Each chapter concludes with a section For Further Reading, directing students to additional resources on specific theologians and theories.</p></p><p><p>Mark Gignilliat (PhD, University of St. Andrews) is assistant professor of divinity at Beeson Divinity School in Alabama, where he has taught Hebrew, Old Testament Exegesis, and Biblical Theology since 2005.

In his second revision of Sherrill Whiton&#x2019;s classic text, Abercrombie presents the full history of interior design&#x2014;during all periods and throughout all regions&#x2014;in a manner that facilitates easy comparisons among different times, places, and styles.</p></p><p><p><b>Stanley Abercrombie</b> has been editor in chief of the magazines <i>Interiors</i> and <i>Interior Design</i>. The author of 10 books, he has taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and has served as a director of the Society of Architectural Historians. <b>Sherrill Whiton</b> was the founder and first president of the New York School of Interior Design.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Sherrill Whiton and his Book</b></p> <p> It has been said that the modern profession of interior design was established by Edith Wharton and Elsie de Wolfe. It might also be said that the modern discipline of interior design was established by Frank Alvah Parsons, for whom the Parsons School of Design was named, and Sherrill Whiton. (In both cases, admittedly, the claims oversimplify a complex history.) </p> <p> Augustus Sherrill Whiton, the author of the original text on which the present book is based, was the founder and first president of the New York School of Interior Design. One might imagine that his text had been developed for the school, but the genesis of the text actually preceded the school (and, by three years, Parsons's own textbook, now long out of print). Whiton was born in New York in 1887, the son of Louis Claude Whiton, a lawyer, and the former Harriet Bell. He earned a degree in architecture at Columbia University, then went to Paris for the study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts that was every architecture students goal at the time. While in Paris, he married Claire Henriette Bouch�. Her family was French, but had moved to New York in the 1870s, and Claire's father, Henri Bouch�, was a designer employed by Tiffany &amp; Co. </p> <p> Back in New York and finding the field of architecture in a slow period, Whiton conceived and wrote a series of Home Study Catalogues in the Decorative Arts. The first catalogue was published in 1916 and was followed by several others. During the next years, Whiton s home study readers frequently stopped at his office on East 40th Street, many of them hoping to find classes being taught there. Finally, in 1924, Whiton opened what was at first called the New York School of Interior Decoration. Its first home was in a building on the southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 57th Street, where the IBM headquarters now stands. </p> <p> The home study manuals were assembled in book form and published by Lippincott in 1937 as <i>Elements of Interior Decoration.</i> The book was reissued in 1944. New editions in 1951, 1957, and 1963 were retitled <i>Elements of interior Design and Decoration,</i> the last of these being published after Whiton's death in 1961. Whiton was succeeded as both the director of the school and the reviser of the textbook by his son, Sherrill ("Pete") Whiton, Jr. After the latter's early and sudden death in 1972, his revision, titled simply <i>Interior Design and Decoration,</i> was also published posthumously. In the late 1980s, Arthur Satz, then president of the New York School of Interior Design, and design writer Nick Polites began a thorough revision, which was to be based on new chapters contributed by a variety of scholarly experts, but that work was never completed. </p> <p> Preparing the present revision has brought heightened respect for Sherrill Whiton's pioneering accomplishment, and it is presented with admiration and gratitude for his work. I also thank the late architect and author Paul Heyer, who, while president of the New York School of Interior Design, first suggested that I undertake the book's revision, and Inge Heckel, Paul's successor, who has been an enthusiastic advocate for the project. Among the many scholars whose ideas I have depended upon are Professor Jody Brotherston of Louisiana Tech University, who helped substantially with the chapter on Spanish design, and Dr. David G. De Long of the University of Pennsylvania, who suggested corrections and clarifications for the first five chapters. Later chapters were reviewed by Mary Ann Beecher, Iowa State University; Denise Bertoncino, University of Arkansas; Theodore Drab, University of Oklahoma; Victoria Brinn Feinberg, CSU at Northridge; Abe Kadushin, Eastern Michigan University; Nancy Kwallek, University of Texas, Austin; James Landis, International Academy of Merchandising Design; Maureen Mitton, University of Wisconsin at Stout; Christine Myers, University of Arkansas; Luann Nissen. University of Nevada, Reno; Sharran Parkinson, Ohio University; Nicholas Politis, Fashion Institute of Technology, New York; Susan Ray-Degges, North Dakota State University; Karen Rutherford, Indiana State University; Margaret Segalla, Brooks College, California; Ludwig Villasi, Kansas State; and Crystal Weaver, Savannah College of Art and Design. </p> <p> At Prentice Hall, I thank publisher Bud Therien, who gave his support to Interior Design as fine art; assistant editor Kimberly Chastain, who has been patient and helpful; Gerald Lombardi, whose fearless (and sometimes ferocious!) suggestions for cutting brought the book down to size; Karen Pugliano, tireless picture researcher who searched far and wide to find the wanted illustration at every point; and Louise Rothman, who somehow kept track of all of the pieces and saw the book through the production process. I am particularly grateful to photographer Peter Paige, Upper Saddle River, NJ, and the Chicago photography studio of Hedrich-Blessing for their skill and generosity. </p> <p><b>To the Instructor: How the Book Has Been Changed</b></p> <p> In many schools of interior design, Sherrill Whitori s book has been known for generations as "the bible," and tampering with the bible, I realize, is heresy. Trying to avert the academic equivalent of being burned at the stake, therefore, I would like to explain what changes have been made. </p> <p><b>Covering the Years Between 1974 and 2000</b></p> <p> With a quarter century having passed since the Whiton book was last readied for publication, it is obvious that new material was needed to cover the interior design developments of that period. Those developments have been many. Stylistically, they include neo-ornamentalism, postmodernism, and deconstructionism, to name only three. Technically, they include new composite materials, new acoustic controls, and new lighting types. The profession itself has new organizations, new certification laws, and new developments in design school accreditation. And the practicing designer faces new fire-safety and abrasion-resistance requirements for furniture and fabrics, new accommodations for universal access, and new issues of environmentalism. This revision attempts to cover all these developments and more. </p> <p><b>Reorganizing the Material</b></p> <p> Another change is that the contents are being presented in a different order. In previous editions of the Whiton book, two long sections, "Period Decoration and Furniture" and "Contemporary Design," together comprising more than two-thirds of the book, chronologically related the history of interior design from antiquity to the present, with the last chapter of the first section giving separately the history of painting and sculpture, retracing the chronology. The sections that followed, "The Basic Interior" and "Selection, Arrangement, and Harmony" (this last section divided in the 1974 edition into "Design Materials and Accessories," and "Interior Planning") gave detailed information about the component materials and techniques developed during that history. In the present edition, the histories of interior design and the fine arts are given together, and the information about materials and techniques has been integrated with those histories, featured along with the accounts of the periods when they were first developed or became important. </p> <p> A final chapter in the 1974 edition, "SocioPsychological Aspects of Interior Design," has been omitted, even its author, my respected colleague Ann Ferebee, now considering it outdated. That does not mean, of course, that interior design does not continue to have social and psychological implications, and references to those implications will be found throughout the book. </p> <p> The organization of the various chapters necessarily varies from one to another, but some attempt has been made at standardization. Chapters generally begin with some consideration of design determinants. Sometimes, as in the case of Egypt, these determinants are predominantly geographical; often, as in the case of India, they are primarily religious; and, increasingly as we approach modern times, they are technological. Also near the beginning of each chapter is a historical summary outlining key periods, dynasties, rulers, or events. After these sketches of design determinants and chronologies, artistic accomplishments are reviewed. In most cases, these are in the order of decreasing scale&#x2014;architecture first, then interior design, then furniture design, and finally decorative arts and decorative details. A summarizing review of common characteristics closes each chapter. </p> <p><b>Broadening the Scope</b></p> <p> The scope of Whiton's original text focused on design in the Western tradition, and that focus still remains. Some enlargements of sections within that tradition have been made, however, and some further ventures into cultures outside that tradition. For example, descriptions of the design of Crete and Persia, each formerly limited to a paragraph between Whiton's chapters on Egypt and Greece, have now been expanded. A former section titled "Miscellaneous Styles and Arts" has been broken apart, its major components now enlarged and placed chronologically within the world picture, resulting in, for example, new chapters on the design of Japan, India, and Islamic design. </p> <p> The motivation for these expansions has not been a desire for "political correctness," legitimate as that may be, but a realistic acknowledgment of the increasing internationalism of today's interior design practice and of today's interior design. The designer of the coming decades will want to be prepared to work globally and will want a broad knowledge of the styles and techniques of many different times, locations, and civilizations. </p> <p><b>Becoming More Visual</b></p> <p> In a textbook on interior design and the decorative arts, a picture may be worth much more than a thousand words. In this revision, the number of color images has been greatly increased, and those images have been distributed more evenly throughout the book.

We believe this work is culturally important and have elected to bring the book back into print as part of our continuing commitment to the preservation of printed works worldwide.</p><p><i>The Science of the Mind</i> was originally published in 1926 by the founder of the worldwide Religious Science movement. It was completely revised in 1938 by Ernest Holmes and Maude Allison Latham; this 1997 edition is the 1938 version with an added introduction by Jean Houston and a one-year study program that breaks the weighty tome into digestible bits. Using creative techniques, Holmes guides the student in easy-to-follow steps toward mastering the powers of the mind to find purpose in life. His explanations of how to pray and meditate, heal oneself spiritually, find self confidence, and express love have helped millions change their lives for the better. <i>The Science of Mind</i> is one of those spiritual classics that belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wishes a life for themselves free of compulsion and negativity. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>The Science of Mind, among the most respected spiritual books of our century, contains the fundamentals of Holmes&#39;s teachings and is a primary resource used by teaching centers and spiritual healers worldwide. The universal principles in this powerful book apply to people of all spiritual backgrounds as they describe the road to freedom attainable through the intelligent use of Nature&#39;s forces and laws to allow God - the creative power of love, freedom, and humanity - to work through them. Holmes seems to have anticipated the future in creativity and personal growth, and his book&#39;s goal is to suggest how you may pilot your entire life. Detailing the amazing, subtle powers of the mind, and how you can use them, it explains many of the basic truths known to the enlightened of all ages, and distills them to primary elements, easily understood.</p><h2>Renegade Women: Gender, Identity, and Boundaries in the Early Modern Mediterranean</h2><p><p>This book uses the stories of early modern women in the Mediterranean who left their birthplaces, families, and religions to reveal the complex space women of the period occupied socially and politically. </p><p>In the narrow sense, the word "renegade" as used in the early modern Mediterranean referred to a Christian who had abandoned his or her religion to become a Muslim. With <i>Renegade Women</i>, Eric R Dursteler deftly redefines and broadens the term to include anyone who crossed the era&#x2019;s and region&#x2019;s religious, political, social, and gender boundaries. Drawing on archival research, he relates three tales of women whose lives afford great insight into both the specific experiences and condition of females in, and the broader cultural and societal practices and mores of, the early Mediterranean. </p><p>Through Beatrice Michiel of Venice, who fled an overbearing husband to join her renegade brother in Constantinople and took the name Fatima Hatun, Dursteler discusses how women could convert and relocate in order to raise their personal and familial status. In the parallel tales of the Christian Elena Civalelli and the Muslim Mihale &#x160;atorovi&#x107;, who both entered a Venetian convent to avoid unwanted, arranged marriages, he finds courageous young women who used the frontier between Ottoman and Venetian states to exercise a surprising degree of agency over their lives. And in the actions of four Muslim women of the Greek island of Milos&#x2015;Aiss�, her sisters Emin� and Catig�, and their mother, Maria&#x2015;who together left their home for Corfu and converted from Islam to Christianity to escape Aiss�&#x2019;s emotionally and financially neglectful husband, Dursteler unveils how a woman&#x2019;s attempt to control her own life ignited an international firestorm that threatened Venetian-Ottoman relations. </p><p>A truly fascinating narrative of female instrumentality, <i>Renegade Women</i> illuminates the nexus of identity and conversion in the early modern Mediterranean through global and local lenses. Scholars of the period will find this to be a richly informative and thoroughly engrossing read.</p></p><p><p><b>Eric R Dursteler</b> is a professor of history at Brigham Young University and the author of <i>Venetians in Constantinople</i>, also published by Johns Hopkins.</p><p>"A gem. Beautifully written, creatively crafted, and thoroughly researched, this is an erudite book, written with verve. It brings to life the richness and vitality of Mediterranean societies in early modern times. It also highlights the lack of historical grounding of some recent popular views about the alleged religious and cultural differences that separate Christian from Islamic societies."</p> (Judith C. Brown, author of <i>Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy</i>)<br><br><p>"Dursteler&#x2019;s book narrates the lives of early modern women who used the religious, cultural, and political boundaries of the early modern Mediterranean to shape the course of their own lives. Dursteler has skillfully teased these women&#x2019;s stories from slender archival evidence and has elegantly placed their experiences in a wider context. These fascinating stories are a wonderful introduction to the way gender, religion, and geography intersected in the eastern Mediterranean, and the book will work particularly well in the classroom as a way to begin discussions of the malleability of religious and gender identities in the early modern world."</p> (Monique O'Connell, author of <i>Men of Empire: Power and Negotiation in Venice&#x2019;s Maritime State</i>)<br><br><p>"Intriguing."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"[<i>Renegade Women</i>] is of tremendous interest to scholars investigating the roles of and opportunities available to women in the early modern period."</p> (Ambereen Dadabhoy <i>Sixteenth Century Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The virtues of this intelligent, wide-ranging study are many, and the overarching one is Dursteler's skillful blending of detailed narratives of individual lives with thoughtful, informed accounts of the major cultural and political currents that formed the framework not only of those lives but also of relations between the Venetian and Ottoman empires."</p> (Stanley Chojnacki <i>Journal of Modern History</i>)</p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Extended Version</h2><p>New extended edition of the classic text, now more than ever tailored to meet the needs of the struggling student.</p><p>PAUL TIPLER formerly taught Physics at Wesleyan University and Oakland University in Michigan.

Her favorite things to draw are illogical mythological creatures.Gr 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;This latest in the science-related graphic novel series turns its focused eye to the world of bats. A little brown bat is lost in a Southwestern desert at night, just as a group of nature lovers are out for a tour. Injured in a commotion with the humans, the bat is taken to a wild animal hospital. This loose story line allows the author to include facts about a wide variety of bats, some native to the area and some not. At the hospital, a number of creatures introduce themselves, describing their eating habits, physical characteristics, and habitats. Humor is abundant throughout, as bats explore their own misinformation about people. Human/bat interactions are a large part of the book, and Koch demystifies commonly held beliefs about bats and discusses habitat loss. The writing is accessible and engaging, and the level of content is detailed enough for young researchers, but casual browsers and graphic novel enthusiasts will find this an attractive choice, too.

Enter her realm online at www.laurieannforest.com.Gr 8 Up&#x2014;It is one thing to be the granddaughter of Carnissa Gardner, the legendary Black Witch, but it's another to be the spitting image of her. Elloren Gardner discovers this from the moment she is uprooted from her uncle's secluded house and enrolled at Verpax University, which is rumored to be "racially integrated," to Elloren's great shock (Elloren shares her aunt's opinion that the integration is "misguided"). While outwardly resembling a bildungsroman, albeit a fantasy one, this novel features a protagonist who remains naive for far too long and, unfortunately, is painfully slow to confront the racist attitudes that she has inherited and that are essential to Gardnerian dominance. By the book's end, readers will wonder if she has learned anything at all. Teens will have to get through hundreds of pages of stereotypical characterizations of marginalized groups (non-Gardnerians are hateful and ultraviolent, their blood is "polluted," they mate like animals, the non-Gardnerian women are trying to steal Gardnerian men, etc.) before Elloren begins to recognize that maybe Gardnerians are the bad guys in her realm. Although unlearning prejudices is a timely theme in YA, Forest handles this issue clumsily. In a particularly rough, tone-deaf scene, mean girl Fallon berates Effrey, a purple-skinned enslaved Urisk girl. Elloren eventually comes to the rescue, and Sparrow, another enslaved girl, approves of her actions with a smile&#x2014;just one of the many white savior&#x2014;like moments throughout. The world-building also leaves a lot to be desired: the Gardnerian creation story is an almost verbatim retelling of Genesis, and there are sporadic, vague mentions of martial arts and elemental spirits in this otherwise "Harry Potter" meets Tolkien universe.

First published in 1837, this pioneering work established Thomas Carlyle's reputation as a historian of enduring scholarly and popular appeal. His scrupulous attention to facts and details, combined with his eloquence, poetic style, and moral energy, convey a spirited sense of reality. The dramatic narrative is populated by vivid characterizations of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre, Lafayette, Marat, and other heroes and villains of the era.<br>"No novelist has made his creations live for us more thoroughly than Carlyle has made the men of the French Revolution," observed George Eliot.

Stephen Dobyns, author of the classic book on the beauty of poetry, <i>Best Words, Best Order</i>, moves into new terrain in this remarkable book. Bringing years of experience to bear on issues such as subject matter, the mechanics of poetry, and the revision process, Dobyns explores the complex relationship between writers and their work. From Philip Larkin to Pablo Neruda to William Butler Yeats, every chapter reveals useful lessons in these renowned poets' work. Both enlightening and encouraging, <i>Next Word, Better Word</i> demystifies a subtle art form and shows writers how to overcome obstacles in the creative process.</p><p><b>Stephen Dobyns</b> is the author of over 30 novels and poetry collections, including <i>The</i> <i>Church of the Dead Girls</i>, <i>Cold Dog Soup</i>, and <i>Cemetery Nights</i>. Among his many honors and awards are a Melville Cane Award, Pushcart Prizes, National Poetry Series prize, and three National Endowment for the Arts fellowships. His novels have been translated into 20 languages, and his poetry has appeared in the <i>Best American Poems</i> anthology. Dobyns teaches creative writing at Warren Wilson College and has taught at the University of Iowa, Sarah Lawrence College.<p>&#x201c;No one but Stephen Dobyns has tackled this impossible genre with such smart, sensible, and charming results. Place this new one next to his <i>Best Words, Best Order</i>, and the poetry-instruction shelf of your library will be complete. All bitten by the poetry bug must read this.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Billy Collins, Poet Laureate of the United States, 2001-2003 and author of Ballistics</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Next Word, Better Order</i> is a gift from a great teacher returning us to the enduring mysteries of the art.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ellen Bryant Voigt, former Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and author of Messenger: New and Selected Poems 1976-2006</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Dobyns, a great American poet, gives a lucid explanation of his craft. This book is valuable for poets, film-makers, novelists, playwrights, and anyone interested in the clear expression of original thought.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Fred Wiseman, film-maker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Dobyns' new book on poetic craft defines, with an impressive breadth of reference, what is required for poets to give their subjects significant form, a nuanced aesthetic embodiment that is true to the poet's deepest concerns and open to a process of discovery, resistant to any idea that might limit a full exploration of the chosen materials. This book should be of genuine interest not only to apprentice poets but to anyone who wants to understand the choices involved in making a poem substantial and persuasive.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Carl Dennis, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry and author of Poetry as Persuasion</i></p><p>&#x201c;Robert Frost said that a poem &#x2018;must begin in delight and end in wisdom.' Here is the rare book about the process of poetry that does both, and brilliantly. Luminous erudition coupled with a palpable love for subject, <i>Next Word, Better Word</i> is sure to be an education and an inspiration for student poets, seasoned poets, and--dare I say--there's plenty here for prose writers, too. Dobyns not only takes us deeply into the matter of the poet's craft, but into the poet himself: how the knowledge necessary to write a good poem intersects with the enlightenment born of experience.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Binnie Kirshenbaum, Writing Chair, School of the Arts Writing Program, Columbia University and author of The Scenic Route</i></p><p>&#x201c;Serious but playful; stylish and true; honest yet magical--this is a comprehensive and beautifully written book about the thorny, joyous art of making poems. It is the best contemporary guide to poetry I have read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Morley, National Teaching Fellow, University of Warwick and author of Enchantment</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Dobyns states in his introduction that &#x2018;writing a poem is one of the ways to love the world,' and the rest of the book demonstrates, in exquisite, careful detail, exactly how. Full of invaluable insights and basic information for aspiring poets, Dobyns' collection also has much to say to his peers--and he peoples his essays with some of the art's most engaging practitioners, from the well-known, such as Baudelaire and Rilke, to those who will be new to many, such as the Russian Acmeists, and most valuably, he gives us their poetry as well their thoughts and lives. It's a book to study, to return to, to annotate with marginalia, but it's also a book to curl up with and simply enjoy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cole Swensen, Professor, Iowa Writers' Workshop and author of Goest</i></p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Dobyns unpacks the essential kit of the trade, all the taken-for-granted tools which poets think with and work with to find out what their poems want to say: line breaks, how syllables behave, the hide-and-seek of metaphor, how a poem hangs on the page like a bird in flight. He enters into dialogue with a galaxy of poets, to help us listen better to poems, to read better, and also maybe write better this most central of arts.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ruth Padel, author of Darwin: A Life in Poems and The Poem and the Journey</i></p></p><h2>Case Files Emergency Medicine</h2><p><p><b>Real life cases for the emergency medicine clerkship and shelf-exam</b></p> <p>You need exposure to high-yield cases to excel on the emergency medicine clerkship and the shelf-exam. <i>Case Files: Emergency Medicine</i> presents 50 real-life cases that illustrate essential concepts in emergency medicine.

In fact, he did both.

Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>MKTG 8 (New, Engaging Titles from 4LTR Press)</h2><p>Signed for today&#39;s students through the continuous feedback from students like you, mktg 8 delivers a visually appealing, succinct print component, tear-out review cards and coursemate, our online digital product that includes learning aids to accommodate your busy lifestyle such as an interactive ebook, self quizzes, downloadable flash cards, review games, online video case studies, and more - all at an affordable price.</p><p>Charles W.

Through well-chosen examples, drawn from his case-method course at Harvard, he helps us to understand the paths chosen and not chosen, and how each generation has adapted to new realities.

Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins.&nbsp; The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next&nbsp;18 years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym "Sirin" and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925, he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri.&nbsp; Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. His most notable works include <i>Bend Sinister&nbsp;</i>(1947),&nbsp;<i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;(1955),&nbsp;<i>Pnin</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Pale Fire</i>&nbsp;(1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.Often outrageous... always a delight * Atlantic *</p><h2>Precalculus: Concepts Through Functions, A Unit Circle Approach to Trigonometry</h2><p><b>Precalculus: Concepts Through Functions, A Unit Circle Approach to Trigonometry, Third Edition</b> focuses on the fundamentals: <i>preparation</i> for class, <i>practice with</i> homework, and <i>reviewing </i>of key concepts.

Close to the rhythms of Negro speech and song, these apparently artless verses -- which, of course, in reality proclaim a poet of sophistication and keen sensibility -- brought to many readers throughout the English-speaking world a new enjoyment of the multifarious voices of Harlem and the other places where Negroes live in large numbers. Since The Weary Blues, Langston Hughes -- to mention only his verse -- has published Fine Clothes to the Jew (1927), The Dream Keeper (1932), Shakespeare in Harlem (1942), Fields of Wonder (1947), One Way Ticket (1949), Montage of a Dream Deferred (1951), Ask Your Mama (1961), and The Panther and the Lash (1967).<br><br>Selected Poems of Langston Hughes represents Langston Hughes's own decisions as to which of his poems he most wanted to preserve and reprint. It contains not only selections from his published books (including private publication), but also poems that either had never been published before or had appeared only in periodicals.<br><br>Here are reflected the rhythms of jazz, the blues, and spirituals. Arna Bontemps has called Langston Hughes the "original jazz poet," and it is worth noting that Hughes in his last years often read his poetry to jazz accompaniment. But there is more in these poems than jazz, its rhythms and its significance. Here, too, are the travail, the joys and accomplishments, the wide-eyed wonder and bitter realizations of a transplanted race. Here, most important of all, are the affirmations and speech of a true poet. Primarily a lyricist, Langston Hughes learned how to speak with intensity of the things that mattered to him, the human factors that he understood and appreciated, whether in praise, in condemnation, or in sheer song.</p><p>With the publication of his first book of poems, The Weary Blues, in 1926, Langston Hughes electrified readers and launched a renaissance in black writing in America. The poems Hughes wrote celebrated the experience of invisible men and women: of slaves who "rushed the boots of Washington"; of musicians on Lenox Avenue; of the poor and the lovesick; of losers in "the raffle of night." They conveyed that experience in a voice that blended the spoken with the sung, that turned poetic lines into the phrases of jazz and blues, and that ripped through the curtain separating high from popular culture. They spanned the range from the lyric to the polemic, ringing out "wonder and pain and terror-- and the marrow of the bone of life." <br>The poems in this collection were chosen by Hughes himself shortly before his death in 1967 and represent work from his entire career, including "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," "The Weary Blues," "Still Here," "Song for a Dark Girl," "Montage of a Dream Deferred," and "Refugee in America." It gives us a poet of extraordinary range, directness, and stylistic virtuosity.Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation from high school, he spent a year in Mexico with his father, then a year studying at Columbia University.&nbsp;&nbsp;His first poem in a nationally known magazine was "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," which appeared in Crisis in 1921.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1925, he was awarded the First Prize for Poetry of the magazine <b>Opportunity</b>, the winning poem being "The Weary Blues," which gave its title to his first book of poems, published in 1926.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of his poetry, Mr. Hughes received a scholarship at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he won his B.A. in 1929.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1943, he was awarded an honorary Litt.D. by his alma mater; he has also been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1935), a Rosenwald Fellowship (1940), and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Grant (1947).&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1926 until his death in 1967, Langston Hughes devoted his time to writing and lecturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote poetry, short stories, autobiography, song lyrics, essays, humor, and plays.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cross section of his work was published in 1958 as <b>The Langston Hughes Reader</b>.</p><h2>Coyote&#39;s Mate (Coyote Breeds, Book 6)</h2><p>For six years Anya Korbin worked with Del-Rey Delgato&#x2014;the genetically altered rebel known as the Coyote Ghost&#x2014;to free a group of coyote women kept in her father&#x2019;s lab.

Nelson-Isaacs has dedicated his life to finding his own sense of purpose, beginning as a student of the Yogic master Sri Swami Satchidananda when he was less than five years old. His writing on topics like flow comes from integrating this experience into his life.

And hopeful. As an elder and a spiritual theologian it moves me to learn from a young physicist who is posing perennial questions from the viewpoint of the new science. Sky Nelson-Isaacs ignites new sparks that shed light on ancient mysteries.

And what have been the environmental consequences? In this broad-ranging book Max Oelschlaeger argues that the idea of wilderness has reflected the evolving character of human existence from Paleolithic times to the present day. An intellectual history, it draws together evidence from philosophy, anthropology, theology, literature, ecology, cultural geography, and archaeology to provide a new scientifically and philosophically informed understanding of humankind&#x2019;s relationship to nature. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to &#x201c;modernism&#x201d; arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America&#x2019;s two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals. </p></p><p>Former U.S. Secretary of the Interior James Watt may have seemed only a passing nightmare in his day, but he acted out of a very old tradition of American attitudes toward the land and its proper use. So did Henry David Thoreau. So did Edward Abbey. Americans have been arguing about the environment since the first boats landed at Jamestown, and by all appearances they'll keep right on arguing into the next millennium. <i>The Idea of Wilderness</i> packs the centuries-old story into a lively narrative with its full complement of heroes--Thoreau, John Muir, Aldo Leopold--a few choice villains of the robber-baron and bureaucrat persuasion, and a few middling souls like Gifford Pinchot, founder of the United States Forest Service. Max Oelschlaeger writes persuasively on the philosophical and religious underpinnings of various environmental positions, showing that indeed there's nothing new under the sun.How has the concept of wild nature changed over the millennia? And what have been the environmental consequences? In a wide-ranging work of intellectual history, Max Oelschlaeger presents a stimulating new examination of humankind&#39;s relationship with the natural world through the ages-from early totemism through Egyptian, Greco-Roman, and Judeo-Christian supernaturalism to the rise of materialism and modernism.</p><h2>George Mason: Forgotten Founder</h2><p>George Mason (1725-92) is often omitted from the small circle of founding fathers celebrated today, but in his service to America he was, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, "of the first order of greatness." Jeff Broadwater provides a comprehensive account of Mason's life at the center of the momentous events of eighteenth-century America. <br><br>Mason played a key role in the Stamp Act Crisis, the American Revolution, and the drafting of Virginia's first state constitution. He is perhaps best known as author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a document often hailed as the model for the Bill of Rights.<br><br>As a Virginia delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Mason influenced the emerging Constitution on point after point. Yet when he was rebuffed in his efforts to add a bill of rights and concluded the document did too little to protect the interests of the South, he refused to sign the final draft. Broadwater argues that Mason's recalcitrance was not the act of an isolated dissenter; rather, it emerged from the ideology of the American Revolution. Mason's concerns about the abuse of political power, Broadwater shows, went to the essence of the American experience.<br><br></p><p>"Fills a major gap in modern biographies of significant Revolutionary figures. . . .

Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, it advanced in three centuries from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at its height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched the empire's aid. In its last three hundred years the empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. In this dazzling evocation of the empire's power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In doing so, he also offers a long look back to the origins of problems that plague present-day Kosovars and Serbs.<br></p><p>Jason Goodwin, a young English journalist, writes history as if it were today's breaking news, and with <i>Lords of the Horizon</i>, he delivers an anecdote-filled and breezy account of the long, troubled career of the Ottoman Empire. That empire endured for nearly 600 years and embraced not only a large territory--stretching, at one point, from the border of Iran to the gates of Vienna--but also hundreds of ethnic groups and three dozen nations. United under the banner of a tolerant form of Islam, the Ottoman Turks forged a culture that, Goodwin writes, "was such a prodigy of pep, such a miracle of human ingenuity, that contemporaries felt it was helped into being by powers not quite human--diabolical or divine, depending on their point of view."<p> Drawing on memoirs by European visitors as well as standard histories of the era, Goodwin traces the Ottoman Empire from its origins in the 14th-century collapse of the Byzantine state to its centuries-long decline and final collapse at the end of World War I. Along the way, he writes of the Ottomans' addiction to wealth (and to hiding their gold in fabulous hoards), the pleasure they took in holding picnics in their lush cemeteries, and the prowess of their elite military both in battle and in organized crime. ("The janissaries were magnificent extortionists," Goodwin notes. "People paid them not to burn their homes and business, then they paid them to come and put the fires out.") Full of vivid detail, Goodwin's narrative makes for an enjoyable introduction to this historically influential, but little understood, culture. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Jason Goodwin, whose previous titles include on <i>Foot to the Golden Horn</i> and <i>A Time for Tea</i>, is a regular contributor to <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i>.

The story of eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove, the tragic heroine of Toni Morrison&#39;s haunting first novel, grew out of her memory of a girlhood friend who wanted blue eyes. Shunned by the town&#39;s prosperous black families, as well as its white families, Pecola lives with her alcoholic father and embittered, overworked mother in a shabby two-room storefront that reeks of the hopeless destitution that overwhelms their lives. In awe of her clean well-groomed schoolmates, and certain of her own intenseugliness, Pecola tries to make herself disappear as she wishes fervently, desperately for the blue eyes of a white girl. In her afterward to this novel, Morrison writes of the little girl she once knew: &#34;Beauty was not simply something to behold, it was something one could do. The Bluest Eye was my effort to say something about that; to say something about why she had not, or possibly never would have, the experience of what she possessed and also why she prayed for so radical an alteration. Implicit in her desire was racial self-loathing. And twenty-years later I was still wondering about how one learns that. Who told her? Who made her feel that it was better to be a freak that what she was? Who had looked at her and found her so wanting, so small a weight on the beauty scale? The novel pecks away at the gaze that condemned her.&#34;</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, April 2000:</b> Originally published in 1970, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: "It required a sophistication unavailable to me." Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself. <p> Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear: </p><blockquote> You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it. </blockquote> There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye. <p> This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin <i>too</i> much of the blame on the beauty myth: "Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion." Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives <i>The Bluest Eye</i> the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of. And that, combined with the novel's modulated pathos and musical, fine-grained language, makes for not merely a sophisticated debut but a permanent one. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"This story commands attention, for it contains one black girl's universe."<br>--Newsweek <p>"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is an inquiry into the reasons why beauty gets wasted in this country.

In his bestselling book <em>Why Christianity Must Change or Die</em>, Spong convincingly demonstrated the limits of traditional faith and the toll its outmoded beliefs take on human life. Now the controversial champion of a more open and progressive Christianity courageously presents his inspiring alternative of what true faith should be today, offering a unified vision of authentic Christian belief for the third millennium.</p><p>What does God look like beyond theism? How do we understand evil? Who is Christ when traditional concepts such as incarnation, atonement, and the Trinity no longer communicate any meaning? In answering these questions, Bishop Spong goes beyond abstract theology to present his vision of a radically new humanity rooted in God, yet matured beyond the need for a supernatural parental deity.</p><p><em>A New Christianity for a New World</em> offers an understanding of Christianity that is free of exclusivity and shame. Bishop Spong empowers those who are disillusioned by religion to discover a God who is the source of life and the source of love, unbounded by the limits of any tradition. The Church of tomorrow, lie writes, must be able to "incorporate all of our reality. It must be able to allow God and Satan to come together in each of us . . . . It must unite Christ with Antichrist, Jesus with Judas, male with female, heterosexual with homosexual."</p><p>After explaining why the traditional understandings of God, Christ, and the rules and dogmas of the Church are not just inoperative but dangerous, Spong offers his contemporary vision of the Church as a community of love, equality, and truth. This work is the ultimate legacy of his struggle to discover and promote a faith system that can live in our new world. Only someone who has spent a lifetime crusading for change and the rights of outcasts in the Church could give voice to such a reasoned, just, and loving faith. With Bishop Spong we can take the brave step to discover the Christianity of tomorrow.</p></p><p>Christianity will not be a viable belief system for honest people in the contemporary world, writes John Shelby Spong, until it drops a few outmoded ideas--for instance, belief in a supernatural God who reveals Himself from outside creation. <i>A New Christianity for a New World</i> continues the work begun in Spong's bestselling <i>Why Christianity Must Change or Die</i>, in which the former Episcopalian bishop diagnosed Christianity's major problems. Here, he offers a vision of what authentic Christian belief might look like today, stripped of theism and all its corollaries (doctrines such as the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Atonement). Christians may come to believe that "God is beyond Jesus, but Jesus participated in the Being of God and Jesus is my way into God." Readers inspired by Dietrich Bonhoeffer's tantalizing writings on "religionless Christianity" in <i>Letters and Papers from Prison</i> and by John A.T. Robinson's <i>Honest to God</i> will find much challenge and comfort in Spong's <i>New Christianity</i>, his most mature and most radical book. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world. His books, which have sold well over a million copies, include <em>Biblical Literalism: A Gentile Heresy; The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic; Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World; Eternal Life: A New Vision; Jesus for the Non-Religious, The Sins of Scripture, Resurrection: Myth or Reality?; Why Christianity Must Change or Die;</em> and his autobiography, <em>Here I Stand</em>.

Each timeless myth is superbly presented in story form and enhanced with original art work by world-renowned artist Giovanni Caselli. Though Bulfinch&#39;s has been heralded for more than a century, it has never been published in so beautiful and accessible a format. Evocative four-color illustrations, many full-page, bring to life key events and characters of these universal tales and sagas -- from the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods to the heroes of the Crusades, from the exploits of Robin Hood to the feats of Richard the Lionheart. As enjoyable now as when Bulfinch first assembled them, these selections come from a variety of works -- Ovid&#39;s classic Metamorphoses, Egyptian myths, Eastern mythology, and Hindu, Norse, and Celtic sources. Together they form a remarkable tapestry of human endeavor: dreams, illusions, adventures, loves lost and loves found. In this handsome series, they speak to us afresh, across the ages, vivified through Caselli&#39;s inspired art. Original footnotes, indexes, and prefaces make this series not only entertaining, but completely authoritative as well.</p><p>Please remove the current &#34;Publisher&#39;s Comments&#34; section that refers to this book as &#34;electronic paperback format.&#34; It is no such thing!

He was brought up in an era when there were three choices in life for young men: be a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. He studied law knowing it would be a stable job with good security. Long, hard hours of study, bar exam, 70-hour workweeks, lots of coffee, and dealing with difficult people were all bumps on his road to success. He fought and worked his way up the ladder and is now a junior partner in a pretty good firm. The days are still long and the stress is ridiculous. He's definitely got less hair.<br><br>His wife stopped working after their second child was born, so he now shoulders the entire financial burden for his family.<br><br>He lives in a pretty nice house in a good neighborhood. They have a pool and a Jacuzzi he hasn't been in since last year. They own a time-share condo that they stress about getting to. Health insurance prices go up each year, and his youngest kid has asthma and some crazy food allergies--all of which cost money and time and create more challenges around the house. Even with a part-time nanny, there seems to be no sleep to be had, and their last vacation to Maui was more trouble than it was worth. He came back exhausted and dejected.<br><br>Robert's life is filled with stress. Although he has a roof over his head, cars, and plenty of food, deep down, he's terrified. He knows he can't keep up at this pace. He feels like he's going to fall on his face one day, but he can't. After all, they all depend on him. He drinks coffee, goes to the gym, takes some multivitamins, and gets an occasional massage, but all the while his mind is filled with the pressures of keeping it all going.<br><br>A good lawyer needs to drive a Lexus.<br><br>Good parents send their kids to private school.<br><br>Gymnastics and piano lessons are a must.<br><br>The other parents are shipping their kids off to some fancy summer camp. Of course, we're in . . .<br><br>The joy is gone. The stress has tipped the scale, and he's constantly trying to keep his chin up. His dad taught him that "real men" never give up; they fight the good fight for their family and never show any weakness. He watches the morning news while eating his cereal with the kids. He feels like an absentee dad who didn't really see them grow up, and he mourns this fact. Robert feels the weakness is gaining momentum, and he is terrified that he's going to lose the battle. After all, with all the stuff he's constantly throwing money at, they barely have any savings, and if he stopped working, they'd be in real trouble within a few months. His life insurance would pay out a decent amount if he keeled over, and a couple of times already, he's thought about it, and this scared the hell out of him.<br><br>Robert is stuck. His adrenals are running on empty, and there's no end in sight. He can't see the way out, and each day, a silent desperation builds in the shadows of his psyche--a plight for the very survival of his family. Robert keeps fighting, but his doctor has warned that his blood pressure is getting too high. The stakes are high, and so are his numbers. What's a man to do?<br><br>THE PROBLEM<br><br>In a way, we all share Robert's problem. Our bodies developed and evolved over millions of years in response to some predictable stressors in our environment. "Fight or flight" is a beautiful system that helped us stay alive in a dangerous world filled with predators and scarcity. It evolved to help us get out of life-threatening situations by optimizing our metabolism to ramp up into crisis mode. When we're in danger, our cortisol and/or adrenaline levels surge to help divert bloodflow to the big muscles that will help us fight an opponent or flee from a predator. These are stress hormones that have top-down control over several systems in our bodies, and slight fluctuations in their levels move dials all over the place. They work in conjunction with an elegant switching mechanism in our nervous system. Our sympathetic nervous system drives the fight-or-flight reactions and quickly helps triage energy to where we need it in times of crisis. The opposite side of this switch is the parasympathetic nervous system, which can be considered the "rest and digest" mode where the body is free to heal, break down foods, and carry out detoxification and excretion. In times of danger, the body is designed to elegantly pull bloodflow from the internal organs, immune system, and parts of the brain that are associated with high cognition and drive that blood into the quadriceps so we can run like hell if we need to. It's great stuff when the shit hits the fan, but let's peel back Robert's life and see why this is bad news for a modern lawyer.<br><br>Robert's stress is not from an acute incident. Sure, occasionally the car in the next lane swerves over and gets his heart rate (and middle finger) up, but that's not what's killing him. It is the chronic stress. A wild impala in Africa doesn't think about the "what if" scenarios of a lion charging. He eats, cruises around, has plenty of sex, and if a threat shows up, he runs for it. If he survives, he shakes it out and goes back to his business. Not us. We keep replaying the event in our minds, bind it to emotions, and visualize it running in different ways; we don't drop it. The impala has moved on, but we're in therapy still talking about it or, worse, still bottling it up. We don't really get into "rest and digest" mode enough to balance these systems out, so we stay wound up.<br><br>Chronic stress is a killer.<br><br>Robert has mini "life or death" moments every time a client threatens to cancel or a judge throws out a case. His wife came home with a fancy purse the other day, and it turned his stomach. "How much did that cost?"<br><br>These modern stressors are basically death by a thousand cuts. Our abstract concept of money or currency is tied to our very survival and triggers the same circuitry. It messes with us and stresses us out. Money is tight, and deep down that means something that our bodies understand viscerally. Low levels of cortisol release over a sustained period of time have terrible consequences for the body. You can say that Robert lives in sympathetic overdrive and has forgotten how to switch back over and chill out. With the body constantly cutting bloodflow to vital systems, here's some of the predictable fallout.<br><br>Restricting Energy to the Immune System<br><br>A body that's under constant stress is like a country at war, and all the money, troops, and resources are being sent to the front lines (stressful fight-or-flight pathways). Who's left to police the streets? How do you deal with local gangs and terror cells? You can't. They sneak in, take hold, and then manifest as disease. By the time you call back troops from the front lines, the damage is done and you need to spend much more energy to fix it.<br><br>The problem is not one of poor design. The human immune system is amazing. It is an elaborate universe that helps us recognize objects that don't belong in our bodies and get rid of them. When things are running smoothly, it is a marvel to witness the precision and efficiency of our immune system. But most people in the modern world are suffering from the consequences of compromised immunity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) attributes stress as the cause of 90 percent of chronic disease. This is huge. Robert is doomed to get some nasty chronic disease once his system gets weak enough. It is just a matter of time.<br><br>The problem is Robert's life.<br><br>Every day, Robert unwittingly does things that draw resources away from his immune system and make it more difficult for his body to maintain balance. After some time, things will break and he will get sick.<br><br>Cutting Energy to the Digestive System and Internal Organs<br><br>When the body gets a signal telling it that a lion is coming, it draws blood from the viscera (internal organs) and drives it to the muscles that can hopefully help us survive the "attack." When this happens, the organs take a hit. Bloodflow is diminished to the organs as it is shunted to the big "get me the hell out of here" muscles. This cuts the energy and nutrients delivered to the vital organs. Think of it like a wartime economy. There's no money left for school books, street repair, or food stamps.<br><br>When the digestive tract gets energy pulled from it regularly, we start to see issues with poor absorption, nutrient deficiencies, constipation or loose stools, indigestion, bloating, fatigue, and eventually leaky gut "syndrome." (I'll explain this later in the book.) "Rest and digest" is where we heal, but what happens when we don't allow ourselves to go there? Look around you. There's a trillion-dollar healthcare industry that makes money off of chronic diseases that stem from poor lifestyle and uncontrolled stress.<br><br>Causing a Blood Sugar Roller Coaster<br><br>When cortisol levels go up, all sorts of things happen. As mentioned earlier, bloodflow is directed to the "get me the hell out of here" muscles, but there's also a huge impact on blood sugar.<br><br>Cortisol is like a credit card.<br><br>In a crisis situation, the body needs energy immediately, so cortisol is like swiping a card to get instant gratification. It helps the body to draw energy from our glycogen reserves in the liver for our immediate needs, but that has some serious consequences. As blood sugar initially surges, the pancreas senses this and releases insulin to grab this sugar and shuttle it into the cells. This is all good, except when things start to fall off the tracks. After years of being on this cortisol energy roller coaster, the insulin spike often overshoots the sugar (energy) release, which then triggers us to get hungry and crave more sugar or carbs in order to balance it out. This can manifest in moodiness, irritability, headaches, and general fatigue; it often leaves us reaching for some coffee to bail us out of an energy lull. Maybe that muffin will help . . . We'll discuss the role of adrenaline in this craziness later in the sleep chapter.<br><br>Most people have so many ups and downs with this that they feel like they're spent by midday Tuesday and are already dreaming of the weekend.<br><br>Wreaking Havoc on the Endocrine System<br><br>I've had dozens of elite athletes come to my clinic and secretly admit that they can't get erections anymore. Cortisol is often the reason why. These athletes burn out their adrenals with chronic elevated stress, and it eventually draws on their testosterone, estrogen, DHEA, and several other hormonal pathways. Robbing Peter to pay Paul seems to be the way of our modern era, and it is surely reflected in our bodies. Today, guys like our friend Robert borrow energy from tomorrow to get through today, but they don't look at the interest rate on that kind of deal. It sucks. Maybe you can bang through your thirties, but then you hit a wall and your body goes on strike. Once our hormones are off, we gain weight, drag around with fatigue, and take a hit in the bedroom . . . sorry, sorry, give me a minute . . .<br><br>Of course, there are drugs we can take for all of these issues, but the root is often bad energy economics stemming from our adrenal burn rate. The drugs often have side effects, and the underlying problem tends to persist.<br><br>Taking a Hit to the Brain<br><br>Possibly the worst on the list of things that happen when we're chronically stressed is the cutting off of bloodflow to the prefrontal cortex. This is the part of our brains that separates us from the monkeys. It helps us carry out abstract thinking, problem solving, higher cognition, and higher moral reasoning. It's the part of the brain that helps with the negation of impulses. This area is called the third eye in the ancient traditions and should be cultivated and cherished. The problem is that the body's switching system knows that this part of the brain is not needed to scramble up a tree as a rhino is charging, so it diverts blood and energy to the hindbrain, which helps with instant reflexive behavior. Again, the body's impulse is "get me out of here or tear through that guy who's trying to take my stuff."<br><br>On the off chance that you encounter a lion in Chicago, that's pretty handy. It also helps you to dive to a curb when a taxi doesn't see you crossing, but chronic misallocation of energy to the fight-or-flight brain keeps us reactive, distrustful, less empathic, and unable to make long- term, thoughtful decisions. Higher moral reasoning is what really made us what we are. Religion, ethics, honor, and self-awareness all come from this good gray matter, and our inability to use it is a tragedy. Most people live in "survival mode" and can relate. It is also a reason why so many people do things that harm them despite knowing better. We know that smoking isn't good for us, but many still do it. We understand that the pie is fattening, yet we eat it anyway. We tell ourselves that our exes are trouble, yet we find ourselves calling them again. Without good access to the prefrontal cortex, we're not using the part of our brains that empowers us to suppress impulses that harm our bodies. Living in chronic stress keeps us locked out of this area of our brains and drives us to be more impulsive and unaware.<br><br>PERSONAL JOURNEYS<br><br>When I came back from the Himalayas, I decided to take on the health-care crisis with my exuberant energy and charged sense of mission. I thought that I could fix a broken system from within, so I started a medical group and quickly grew it to three offices. We were featured in journals for our innovations in complementary medicine and were getting cool accolades, but I knew it was bullshit. Essentially, my training was in the prevention and prediction of disease, and here I was in a business model that required me to wait for someone to break and come in with a diagnosable illness. I kept trying to find work-arounds within this messy system and constantly dealt with insurance companies holding our money. There was an immense amount of stress, and it really put my meditation skills to the test.</p><h2>Sir Charles Grandison (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>First published in 1753, Richardson&#39;s third novel was immensely popular.

Controlling crime along 250 miles of the Rio Grande, he was responsible for creating a narcotics hub in northern Mexico that smuggled 60 tons of cocaine a year into the United States. This book chronicles Pablo Acosta's bloody rise and his spectacular fall at the hands of the same system that had protected him until he made the mistake of talking to a U.S. reporter&#x2014;the author&#x2014;about the arrangement. Also included are details about Pablo Acosta's successor, Amado Carrillo Fuentes.</p><p>Drug Lord was first published in 1990. The new version is an essential update with never before published information about Pablo Acosta&#39;s partner, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Carrillo Fuentes, the infamous &#34;Lord of the Skies,&#34; took over where Acosta left off and built the greatest narcotics smuggling organization ever in the Western Hemisphere. The new version, about 100 pages longer than the original work, also tracks the career of the fearsome Comandante Calderoni, the Mexican federal police commander who killed Acosta. Calderoni later defected to the United States, gaining asylum here after spilling his guts to the FBI about the involvement of the Mexican presidential family in drug trafficking.<b>Terrence E.

Indeed, we know Steiner today mostly because of the various applications of his ideas in such areas as education, medicine, and agriculture. However, society could not have developed any of these without the coherent and profound body of spiritual knowledge at the core of Steiner's work.<br><br>In <i>Rosicrucian Wisdom</i>&#x2015;one of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s most complete introductions to modern spirituality&#x2015;he speaks from the very stream of Rosicrucian teaching. Rather than borrowing old ideas from historical tradition, however, he presents a wholly new contribution that arises from the results of his own experiential, spiritual research. <br><br>Steiner discusses of the Rosicrucian path as the one appropriate for modern spiritual seekers in the West. He warns the reader that Rosicrucian teaching should not be taken as abstract theory; rather than remaining in the head, or even in the heart, spiritual ideas should reach into daily action and transform all aspects of life. He goes on to describe many facets of spiritual truth, including the law of destiny, the fact of life after death, means of developing spiritual vision, humanity&#x2019;s past and future evolution, and much more. <br><br> This volume contains one of the best lecture courses for gaining a deeper understanding of the spiritual principles behind Anthroposophy. <br><br><b>Listen to lecture 1 (mp3)</b><br><br><i>Rosicrucian Wisdom</i> is a translation from the German <i>Die Theosophie des Rosenkreuzers</i> (GA 99). A previous translation was titled <i>The Theosophy of the Rosicrucians</i>.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>A-Z of Sewing for Smockers</h2><p>Part of the bestselling A-Z series of specialist needlework books, this extensive how-to text focuses on garment construction for smocking enthusiasts and is the ideal companion to the A-Z of Smocking.

Now Desai takes us to the northeastern Himalayas where a rising insurgency challenges the old way of life. In a crumbling, isolated house at the foot of Mount Kanchenjunga lives an embittered old judge who wants to retire in peace when his orphaned granddaughter Sai arrives on his doorstep. The judge's chatty cook watches over her, but his thoughts are mostly with his son, Biju, hopscotching from one New York restaurant job to another, trying to stay a step ahead of the INS, forced to consider his country's place in the world. When a Nepalese insurgency in the mountains threatens Sai's new-sprung romance with her handsome Nepali tutor and causes their lives to descend into chaos, they, too, are forced to confront their colliding interests. The nation fights itself. The cook witnesses the hierarchy being overturned and discarded. The judge must revisit his past, his own role in this grasping world of conflicting desires-every moment holding out the possibility for hope or betrayal. A novel of depth and emotion, Desai's second, long-awaited novel fulfills the grand promise established by her first.</p><p><b>Kiran Desai</b> was born in India in 1971. Her last book was the critically acclaimed <i>Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard.</i> Educated in India, England, and the United States, she continues, like the characters in this book, to divide her time between places, with mixed results.<p>One<br> <br></p><p><i>All day,</i> the colors had been those of dusk, mist moving like a water creature across the great flanks of mountains possessed of ocean shadows and depths. Briefly visible above the vapor, Kanchenjunga was a far peak whittled out of ice, gathering the last of the light, a plume of snow blown high by the storms at its summit.<br> <br></p><p>Sai, sitting on the veranda, was reading an article about giant squid in an old <i>National Geographic.</i> Every now and then she looked up at Kanchenjunga, observed its wizard phosphorescence with a shiver. The judge sat at the far corner with his chessboard, playing against himself. Stuffed under his chair where she felt safe was Mutt the dog, snoring gently in her sleep. A single bald lightbulb dangled on a wire above. It was cold, but inside the house, it was still colder, the dark, the freeze, contained by stone walls several feet deep.</p><p><br> Here, at the back, inside the cavernous kitchen, was the cook, trying to light the damp wood. He fingered the kindling gingerly for fear of the community of scorpions living, loving, reproducing in the pile. Once he'd found a mother, plump with poison, fourteen babies on her back.</p><p><br> Eventually, the fire caught and he placed his kettle on top, as battered, as encrusted as something dug up by an archeological team, and waited for it to boil. The walls were singed and sodden, garlic hung by muddy stems from the charred beams, thickets of soot clumped batlike upon the ceiling. The flame cast a mosaic of shiny orange across the cook's face, and his top half grew hot, but a mean gust tortured his arthritic knees.</p><p><br> Up through the chimney and out, the smoke mingled with the mist that was gathering speed, sweeping in thicker and thicker, obscuring things in parts&#x2014;half a hill, then the other half. The trees turned into silhouettes, loomed forth, were submerged again. Gradually the vapor replaced everything with itself, solid objects with shadow, and nothing remained that did not seem molded from or inspired by it. Sai's breath flew from her nostrils in drifts, and the diagram of a giant squid constructed from scraps of information, scientists&#x2019; dreams, sank entirely into the murk.</p><p><br> She shut the magazine and walked out into the garden. The forest was old and thick at the edge of the lawn; the bamboo thickets rose thirty feet into the gloom; the trees were moss-slung giants, bunioned and misshapen, tentacled with the roots of orchids. The caress of the mist through her hair seemed human, and when she held her fingers out, the vapor took them gently into its mouth. She thought of Gyan, the mathematics tutor, who should have arrived an hour ago with his algebra book.</p><p><br> But it was 4:30 already and she excused him with the thickening mist. When she looked back, the house was gone; when she climbed the steps back to the veranda, the garden vanished. The judge had fallen asleep and gravity acting upon the slack muscles, pulling on the line of his mouth, dragging on his cheeks, showed Sai exactly what he would look like if he were dead.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Where is the tea?&#x201d; he woke and demanded of her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s late,&#x201d; said the judge, meaning the cook with the tea, not Gyan.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get it,&#x201d; she offered.</p><p><br> The gray had permeated inside, as well, settling on the silverware, nosing the corners, turning the mirror in the passageway to cloud. Sai, walking to the kitchen, caught a glimpse of herself being smothered and reached forward to imprint her lips upon the surface, a perfectly formed film star kiss. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said, half to herself and half to someone else.</p><p><br> No human had ever seen an adult giant squid alive, and though they had eyes as big as apples to scope the dark of the ocean, theirs was a solitude so profound they might never encounter another of their tribe. The melancholy of this situation washed over Sai.</p><p>Could fulfillment ever be felt as deeply as loss? Romantically she decided that love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfillment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love was the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself.</p><p>---</p><p>The water boiled and the cook lifted the kettle and emptied it into the teapot.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Terrible,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My bones ache so badly, my joints hurt&#x2014;I may as well be dead. If not for Biju. . . .&#x201d; Biju was his son in America. He worked at Don Pollo&#x2014;or was it The Hot Tomato? Or Ali Baba's Fried Chicken? His father could not remember or understand or pronounce the names, and Biju changed jobs so often, like a fugitive on the run&#x2014;no papers.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s so foggy,&#x201d; Sai said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the tutor will come.&#x201d; She jigsawed the cups, saucers, teapot, milk, sugar, strainer, Marie and Delite biscuits all to fit upon the tray.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; she offered.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Careful, careful,&#x201d; he said scoldingly, following with an enamel basin of milk for Mutt. Seeing Sai swim forth, spoons making a jittery music upon the warped sheet of tin, Mutt raised her head. &#x201c;Teatime?&#x201d; said her eyes as her tail came alive.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Why is there nothing to eat?&#x201d; the judge asked, irritated, lifting his nose from a muddle of pawns in the center of the chessboard. He looked, then, at the sugar in the pot: dirty, micalike glinting granules. The biscuits looked like cardboard and there were dark finger marks on the white of the saucers. Never ever was the tea served the way it should be, but he demanded at least a cake or scones, macaroons or cheese straws. Something sweet and something salty. This was a travesty and it undid the very concept of teatime.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Only biscuits,&#x201d; said Sai to his expression. &#x201c;The baker left for his daughter&#x2019;s wedding.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want biscuits.&#x201d;</p><p><br> Sai sighed.</p><p><br> &#x201c;How dare he go for a wedding? Is that the way to run a business? The fool. Why can&#x2019;t the cook make something?&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no more gas, no kerosene.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Why the hell can&#x2019;t he make it over wood? All these old cooks can make cakes perfectly fine by building coals around a tin box. You think they used to have gas stoves, kerosene stoves, before? Just too lazy now.&#x201d;</p><p><br> The cook came hurrying out with the leftover chocolate pudding warmed on the fire in a frying pan, and the judge ate the lovely brown puddle and gradually his face took on an expression of grudging pudding contentment.</p><p><br> They sipped and ate, all of existence passed over by nonexistence, the gate leading nowhere, and they watched the tea spill copious ribbony curls of vapor, watched their breath join the mist slowly twisting and turning, twisting and turning.</p><p><br> ---</p><p>Nobody noticed the boys creeping across the grass, not even Mutt, until they were practically up the steps. Not that it mattered, for there were no latches to keep them out and nobody within calling distance except Uncle Potty on the other side of the <i>jhora</i> ravine, who would be drunk on the floor by this hour, lying still but feeling himself pitch about&#x2014;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind me, love,&#x201d; he always told Sai after a drinking bout, opening one eye like an owl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just lie down right here and take a little rest&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p><br> They had come through the forest on foot, in leather jackets from the Kathmandu black market, khaki pants, bandanas&#x2014;universal guerilla fashion.<br> <br> One of the boys carried a gun.</p><p><br> Later reports accused China, Pakistan, and Nepal, but in this part of the world, as in any other, there were enough weapons floating around for an impoverished movement with a ragtag army. They were looking for anything they could find&#x2014;kukri sickles, axes, kitchen knives, spades, any kind of firearm.</p><p><br> They had come for the judge&#x2019;s hunting rifles.</p><p><br> Despite their mission and their clothes, they were unconvincing. The oldest of them looked under twenty, and at one yelp from Mutt, they screamed like a bunch of schoolgirls, retreated down the steps to cower behind the bushes blurred by mist. &#x201c;Does she <i>bite,</i> Uncle? <i>My God!</i>&#x201d;&#x2014; shivering there in their camouflage.</p><p><br> Mutt began to do what she always did when she met strangers: she turned a furiously wagging bottom to the intruders and looked around from behind, smiling, conveying both shyness and hope.</p><p><br> Hating to see her degrade herself thus, the judge reached for her, whereupon she buried her nose in his arms.</p><p><br> The boys came back up the steps, embarrassed, and the judge became conscious of the fact that this embarrassment was dangerous for had the boys projected unwavering confidence, they might have been less inclined to flex their muscles.</p><p><br> The one with the rifle said something the judge could not understand.</p><p><br> &#x201c;No Nepali?&#x201d; he spat, his lips sneering to show what he thought of that, but he continued in Hindi. &#x201c;Guns?&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;We have no guns here.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Get them.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;You must be misinformed.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Never mind with all this <i>nakhra.</i> Get them.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I order you,&#x201d; said the judge, &#x201c;to leave my property at once.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Bring the weapons.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I will call the police.&#x201d;</p><p><br> This was a ridiculous threat as there was no telephone.</p><p><br> They laughed a movie laugh, and then, also as if in a movie, the boy with the rifle pointed his gun at Mutt. &#x201c;Go on, get them, or we will kill the dog first and you second, cook third, ladies last,&#x201d; he said, smiling at Sai.</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get them,&#x201d; she said in terror and overturned the tea tray as she went.</p><p><br> The judge sat with Mutt in his lap. The guns dated from his days in the Indian Civil Service. A BSA five-shot barrel pump gun, a .30 Springfield rifle, and a double-barreled rifle, Holland &amp; Holland. They weren&#x2019;t even locked away: they were mounted at the end of the hall above a dusty row of painted green and brown duck decoys.</p><p><br> &#x201c;<i>Chtch,</i> all rusted. Why don&#x2019;t you take care of them?&#x201d; But they were pleased and their bravado bloomed. &#x201c;We will join you for tea.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;Tea?&#x201d; asked Sai in numb terror.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Tea and snacks. Is this how you treat guests? Sending us back out into the cold with nothing to warm us up.&#x201d; They looked at one another, at her, looked up, down, and winked.</p><p><br> She felt intensely, fearfully female.</p><p><br> Of course, all the boys were familiar with movie scenes where hero and heroine, befeathered in cosy winterwear, drank tea served in silver tea sets by polished servants. Then the mist would roll in, just as it did in reality, and they sang and danced, playing peekaboo in a nice resort hotel. This was classic cinema set in Kulu-Manali or, in preterrorist days, Kashmir, before gunmen came bounding out of the mist and a new kind of film had to be made.</p><p><br> The cook was hiding under the dining table and they dragged him out.</p><p><i><br> &#x201c;Ai aaa, ai aaa,&#x201d;</i> he joined his palms together, begging them, &#x201c;please, I&#x2019;m a poor man, please.&#x201d; He held up his arms and cringed as if from an expected blow.</p><p><br> &#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t done anything, leave him,&#x201d; said Sai, hating to see him humiliated, hating even more to see that the only path open to him was to humiliate himself further.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Please living only to see my son please don't kill me please <i>I&#x2019;m a poor man spare me.</i>&#x201d;</p><p><br> His lines had been honed over centuries, passed down through generations, for poor people needed certain lines; the script was always the same, and they had no option but to beg for mercy. The cook knew instinctively how to cry.</p><p><br> These familiar lines allowed the boys to ease still further into their role, which he had handed to them like a gift.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Who wants to kill you?&#x201d; they said to the cook. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just hungry, that&#x2019;s all. Here, your sahib will help you. Go on,&#x201d; they said to the judge, &#x201c;you know how it should be done properly.&#x201d; The judge didn&#x2019;t move, so the boy pointed the gun at Mutt again.</p><p><br> The judge grabbed her and put her behind him.</p><p><br> &#x201c;Too soft-hearted, sahib. You should show this kind side to your guests, also. Go on, prepare the table.&#x201d;</p><p><br> The judge found himself in the kitchen where he had never been, not once, Mutt wobbling about his toes, Sai and the cook too scared to look, averting their gaze.</p><p><br> It came to them that they might all die with the judge in the kitchen; the world was upside down and absolutely anything could happen.</p></p><h2>Inductive Preaching: Helping People Listen</h2><p><p><em>"I spend hours in my study and on my knees preparing sermons, but when I preach them no one listens.

Leaves rustle underfoot in a dark wood: two middle-aged women walk into a forest, as they did when they were girls, confronting their childhood fears and memories and the strange thing they saw&#x2013;or thought they saw&#x2013;so long ago. A distinguished male obstetrician and a young woman artist meet in a hospital, but they have very different ideas about body parts, birth, and death. A man meets the ghost of his living wife; a woman turns to stone. And an innocent member of an evening creative writing class turns out to have her own decided views on the best way to use &#x201c;raw material.&#x201d;<br><br>These unforgettable stories are by turns haunting, funny, sparkling, and scary. Byatt&#x2019;s <i>Little Black Book </i>adds a deliciously dark note to her skill in mixing folk and fairy tales with everyday life.</p><p>A. S. Byatt is the author of numerous novels, including <i>A Whistling Woman </i>and <i>Possession,</i> which was awarded the Booker Prize in 1990. She has also written two novellas, published together as <i>Angels and Insects,</i> four previous collections of shorter works, and several works of nonfiction. Educated at Cambridge, she was a senior lecturer in English at University College London. She lives in LondonThere were once two little girls who saw, or believed they saw, a thing in a forest. The two little girls were evacuees, who had been sent away from the city by train, with a large number of other children. They all had their names attached to their coats with safety-pins, and they carried little bags or satchels, and the regulation gas-mask. They wore knitted scarves and bonnets or caps, and many had knitted gloves attached to long tapes which ran along their sleeves, inside their coats, and over their shoulders and out, so that they could leave their ten woollen fingers dangling, like a spare pair of hands, like a scarecrow. They all had bare legs and scuffed shoes and wrinkled socks. Most had wounds on their knees in varying stages of freshness and scabbiness. They were at the age when children fall often and their knees were unprotected. With their suitcases, some of which were almost too big to carry, and their other impedimenta, a doll, a toy car, a comic, they were like a disorderly dwarf regiment, stomping along the platform.<br><br>The two little girls had not met before, and made friends on the train. They shared a square of chocolate, and took alternate bites at an apple. One gave the other the inside page of her Beano. Their names were Penny and Primrose. Penny was thin and dark and taller, possibly older, than Primrose, who was plump and blonde and curly. Primrose had bitten nails, and a velvet collar to her dressy green coat. Penny had a bloodless transparent paleness, a touch of blue in her fine lips. Neither of them knew where they were going, nor how long the journey might take. They did not even know why they were going, since neither of their mothers had quite known how to explain the danger to them. How do you say to your child, I am sending you away, because enemy bombs may fall out of the sky, because the streets of the city may burn like forest fires of brick and timber, but I myself am staying here, in what I believe may be daily danger of burning, burying alive, gas, and ultimately perhaps a grey army rolling in on tanks over the suburbs, or sailing its submarines up our river, all guns blazing? So the mothers (who did not resemble each other at all) behaved alike, and explained nothing, it was easier. Their daughters they knew were little girls, who would not be able to understand or imagine.<br><br>The girls discussed on the train whether it was a sort of holiday or a sort of punishment, or a bit of both. Penny had read a book about Boy Scouts, but the children on the train did not appear to be Brownies or Wolf Cubs, only a mongrel battalion of the lost. Both little girls had the idea that these were all perhaps not very good children, possibly being sent away for that reason. They were pleased to be able to define each other as &#x201c;nice.&#x201d; They would stick together, they agreed. Try to sit together, and things.<br>The train crawled sluggishly further and further away from the city and their homes. It was not a clean train&#x2014;the upholstery of their carriage had the dank smell of unwashed trousers, and the gusts of hot steam rolling backwards past their windows were full of specks of flimsy ash, and sharp grit, and occasional fiery sparks that pricked face and fingers like hot needles if you opened the window. It was very noisy too, whenever it picked up a little speed. The engine gave great bellowing sighs, and the invisible wheels underneath clicked rhythmically and monotonously, tap-tap-tap-CRASH, tap-tap-tap-CRASH. The window-panes were both grimy and misted up. The train stopped frequently, and when it stopped, they used their gloves to wipe rounds, through which they peered out at flooded fields, furrowed hillsides and tiny stations whose names were carefully blacked out, whose platforms were empty of life.<br><br>The children did not know that the namelessness was meant to baffle or delude an invading army. They felt&#x2014;they did not think it out, but somewhere inside them the idea sprouted&#x2014;that the erasure was because of them, because they were not meant to know where they were going or, like Hansel and Gretel, to find the way back. They did not speak to each other of this anxiety, but began the kind of conversation children have about things they really disliked, things that upset, or disgusted, or frightened them. Semolina pudding with its grainy texture, mushy peas, fat on roast meat. Listening to the stairs and the window-sashes creaking in the dark or the wind. Having your head held roughly back over the basin to have your hair washed, with cold water running down inside your liberty bodice. Gangs in playgrounds. They felt the pressure of all the other alien children in all the other carriages as a potential gang. They shared another square of chocolate, and licked their fingers, and looked out at a great white goose flapping its wings beside an inky pond.<br><br>The sky grew dark grey and in the end the train halted. The children got out, and lined up in a crocodile, and were led to a mud-coloured bus. Penny and Primrose managed to get a seat together, although it was over the wheel, and both of them began to feel sick as the bus bumped along snaking country lanes, under whipping branches, dark leaves on dark wooden arms on a dark sky, with torn strips of thin cloud streaming across a full moon, visible occasionally between them.<br>They were billeted temporarily in a man- sion commandeered from its owner, which was to be arranged to hold a hospital for the long-term disabled, and a secret store of artworks and other valuables. The children were told they were there temporarily, until families were found to take them all into their homes. Penny and Primrose held hands, and said to each other that it would be wizard if they could go to the same family, because at least they would have each other. They didn&#x2019;t say anything to the rather tired-looking ladies who were ordering them about, because with the cunning of little children, they knew that requests were most often counter-productive, adults liked saying no. They imagined possible families into which they might be thrust. They did not discuss what they imagined, as these pictures, like the black station signs, were too frightening, and words might make some horror solid, in some magical way. Penny, who was a reading child, imagined Victorian dark pillars of severity, like Jane Eyre&#x2019;s Mr. Brocklehurst, or David Copperfield&#x2019;s Mr. Murdstone. Primrose imagined&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t know why&#x2014;a fat woman with a white cap and round red arms who smiled nicely but made the children wear sacking aprons and scrub the steps and the stove. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like we were orphans,&#x201d; she said to Penny. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Penny said. &#x201c;If we manage to stick together . . .&#x201d;<br>The great house had a double flight of imposing stairs to its front door, and carved griffins and unicorns on its balustrade. There was no lighting, because of the black-out. All the windows were shuttered. No welcoming brightness leaked across door or windowsill. The children trudged up the staircase in their crocodile, hung their coats on numbered makeshift hooks, and were given supper (Irish stew and rice pudding with a dollop of blood-red jam) before going to bed in long makeshift dormitories, where once servants had slept. They had camp-beds (military issue) and grey shoddy blankets. Penny and Primrose got beds together but couldn&#x2019;t get a corner. They queued to brush their teeth in a tiny washroom, and both suffered (again without speaking) suffocating anxiety about what would happen if they wanted to pee in the middle of the night, because the lavatory was one floor down, the lights were all extinguished, and they were a long way from the door. They also suffered from a fear that in the dark the other children would start laughing and rushing and teasing, and turn themselves into a gang. But that did not happen. Every- one was tired and anxious and orphaned. An uneasy silence, a drift of perturbed sleep, came over them all. The only sounds&#x2014;from all parts of the great dormitory it seemed&#x2014;were suppressed snuffles and sobs, from faces pressed into thin pillows.<br><br>When daylight came, things seemed, as they mostly do, brighter and better. The children were given breakfast in a large vaulted room. They sat at trestle tables, eating porridge made with water and a dab of the red jam, heavy cups of strong tea. Then they were told they could go out and play until lunch-time. Children in those days&#x2014;wherever they came from&#x2014;were not closely watched, were allowed to come and go freely, and those evacuated children were not herded into any kind of holding-pen, or transit camp. They were told they should be back for lunch at 12:30, by which time those in charge hoped to have sorted out their provisional future lives. It was not known how they would know when it was 12:30, but it was expected that&#x2014;despite the fact that few of them had wrist-watches&#x2014;they would know how to keep an eye on the time. It was what they were used to.<br><br>Penny and Primrose went out together, in their respectable coats and laced shoes, on to the terrace. The terrace appeared to them to be vast, and was indeed extensive. It was covered with a fine layer of damp gravel, stained here and there bright green, or invaded by mosses. Beyond it was a stone balustrade, with a staircase leading down to a lawn, which that morning had a quicksilver sheen on the lengthening grass. It was flanked by long flower-beds, full of overblown annuals and damp clumps of stalks. A gardener would have noticed the beginnings of neglect, but these were urban little girls, and they noticed the jungly mass of wet stems, and the wet, vegetable smell. Across the lawn, which seemed considerably vaster than the vast terrace, was a sculpted yew hedge, with many twigs and shoots out of place and ruffled. In the middle of the hedge was a wicket-gate, and beyond the gate were trees, woodland, a forest, the little girls said to themselves.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go into the f...</p><h2>Good Husband Material (Hometown Heartbreakers)</h2><p>Good Husband Material by Susan Mallery released on Oct 25, 2002 is available now for purchase.</p><p></p><h2>When the English Fall: A Novel</h2><p><b>A riveting and unexpected novel that questions whether a peaceful and non- violent community can survive when civilization falls apart.</b><br><br><i>Again, all are asleep, but I am not.

The journal&#x2019;s author is an Amish man named Jacob, who firmly believes in his religion&#x2019;s dedication to peace, family, and community. It is in his words that the story begins and ends, as day by day Jacob records his family&#x2019;s life on their Pennsylvania farm and their interactions with the English. When an unprecedented disaster brings nearby cities to a grinding halt, the cities&#x2019; inhabitants turn to the Amish farmers for help; but they also intrude upon them with violence. As lawlessness and acts of savagery intensify, Jacob&#x2019;s peaceful community is forced to make hard decisions. Author David Williams grants us access into a closed society, a reminder of how reliant the rest of us are on technology to sustain our way of life&#x2014;and that even the most steadfast will struggle in the face of chaos. <em>When the English Fall</em> is a gripping story, with an ending that made me want to go back and read it all again...<em>--Seira Wilson</em><b>&#x201c;A standout among post-apocalyptic novels, as simply and perfectly crafted as an Amish quilt or table.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> &#x201c;<i>When the English Fall</i> takes its place in the landscape of post-collapse survivalist fiction as satisfyingly as a puzzle piece clicking into a gap.

Loner Iry Paret, a country-and-western musician, has survived two years of hacks, trustees and dangerous inmates, not with hope but with a dull, gloomy attentiveness that has written hardship's effects all over him. Once he is paroled, he drinks liquor as if it were a tonic, but even drinking brings no joy. He travels to a fellow prisoner's ranch, and as he heads west, the air clears. His involvement with his acid-dropping pal Buddy Rior dan, Buddy's stoical ex-cowboy father (who feuds with a foul-odored pulpmill) and Buddy's estranged wife, Beth, tugs him between adjustment to straight life and the battles that may send him back to jail. Although the ending strays, this latest novel by the author of The Convict is pensive and cautiously paced. It also contrasts two very different parts of the essence of Americathe hazy bayou and a resolute valley in the beautiful West. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mrs. Jeffries Plays the Cook (Victorian Mystery)</h2><p><b>Meet the inspector and Mrs. Jeffries--in a delightful mystery series set in Victorian England--and featuring the most charming characters ever to crack a case.<br><br> STICKY FINGERS, HELPING HANDS...</b><br><br> Minerva Kenny is a dear woman, but her tendency to "borrow" things without asking has finally caught up with her.

She had been intrigued when Jacky contacted her about filming the entire project. According to Jacky, MCMR would be the next great thing. Mid-Century-Modern Renovations was due to air on Home &amp; Garden TV sometime in the not too distant future, but there was always a chance it would follow the lead of some of the Food Network&#x2019;s cooking shows and make the jump over to one of the major networks.<br> <br>Jacky had begged and pleaded until Ali finally agreed. At first her contractor had been thrilled at the prospect, and his crew had enjoyed mugging for the two cameramen, Raymond and Robert. Now, though, with construction seriously behind schedule, the workers were becoming surly at having the cameras forever in the way, and so was Ali. It was bad enough when things were going well. But then there were days like today, when Bryan Forester, her general contractor, had gone ballistic after Yvonne Kirkpatrick, the city of Sedona&#x2019;s queen-bee building inspector, had decreed that the placement of some of Bryan&#x2019;s electrical outlets in both the bathrooms and the kitchen were out of compliance.<br> <br>The cameras had been there filming the entire epic battle as Bryan and the fiery-haired Yvonne had gone at it nose-to-nose over the issue. Later, they had been missing in action when Yvonne, who had returned to her office to check the rules and regs, had called back with the embarrassing admission that Bryan had been right and she had been wrong. From her days as a television newscaster, Ali Reynolds knew the drill. After all, confrontations make for great TV. Reconciliations don&#x2019;t. Compared to war, peace is B-O-R-I-N-G. And even though Yvonne had admitted her mistake, she had yet to come back and sign off on the permit. The drywall guys couldn&#x2019;t start hanging wallboard until she did.<br> <br>Ali had hoped to have the place ready for a grand Thanksgiving dinner unveiling for friends and family. Right now her house had no running water or electricity, and the interior walls were nothing but bare studs. This latest delay made a turkey-day gathering in her remodeled home even more unlikely. Disheartened, she had retreated to the wisteria-lined flagstone patio where they had erected a canvas canopy over the worn redwood picnic table that served as a lunchroom for workers and film crew alike. Before Ali could summon a really serious funk, though, Leland Brooks appeared, bearing a silver tray set for tea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tea?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You look as though you could use a cuppa.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; Ali said gratefully, shivering in the late-afternoon chill. &#x201c;That would be wonderful.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali had taken on restoring Arabella Ashcroft&#x2019;s dilapidated home as her personal rehabilitation project, and Brooks, Arabella&#x2019;s former butler, had made fixing Ali Reynolds his. Months earlier and already dealing with the end of both her newscasting career and the end of her marriage, Ali had abandoned California and returned to her roots in Sedona, Arizona, looking for respite and a little peace and quiet. That hadn&#x2019;t worked very well. Instead of achieving idyllic serenity, she had been propelled into life-and-death struggles with not one but two murderous nutcases.<br> <br>Afterward Ali had been drifting aimlessly into a sea of depression when Leland Brooks came to her rescue, determined to find a way to help her help herself. Refusing to take no for an answer, he had set before her the daunting challenge of buying and re-creating Arabella Ashcroft&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house. In the ensuing months, every time the resulting complications had threatened to overwhelm Ali, Leland had been at her side. He still referred to himself as her butler, but she saw him as her property manager and also as her trusted aide-de-camp. He had taken up residence in a fifth-wheel trailer set up in the driveway, where he could make sure tools and supplies stayed put when the workmen left the site.<br> <br>Ali waited while Leland dosed her tea with two cubes of sugar and a wedge of lemon.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see that building inspector was here again,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Ali returned. &#x201c;She rode in on her broom, out on same, and fouled up the wallboard guys for at least another day. I&#x2019;m pretty sure Thanksgiving is a lost cause.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leland handed over a cup and saucer. &#x201c;Mr. Forester is a good man,&#x201d; he said thoughtfully. &#x201c;Surely he&#x2019;ll be able to find a way to carry us over the finish line.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali took a sip of her tea. It was perfect. &#x201c;Mr. Brooks,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;has anyone ever told you that you&#x2019;re an incurable optimist?&#x201d;<br> <br>Leland frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose that&#x2019;s a compliment, is it?&#x201d; he returned.<br> <br>Ali laughed aloud. No matter how bad things got, Leland always seemed to cheer her up. Just then a car came winding up the driveway, threading its way between lines of workers&#x2019; vehicles. As it parked behind Ali&#x2019;s Porsche Cayenne SUV, she recognized Detective Dave Holman&#x2019;s sheriff&#x2019;s department sedan.<br> <br>Dave, a fellow graduate of Cottonwood&#x2019;s Mingus Union High, was a longtime friend and recently a sometime beau. Several months earlier, he had been granted primary custody of his two daughters, nine-year-old Cassie and thirteen-year-old Crystal. Since then Dave had thrown himself wholeheartedly into his unexpected second chance at fatherhood. His newly assumed parenting responsibilities combined with a realization that both Dave and Ali were in full rebound mode had led to a mutual decision to back off for a while. As a result, he and Ali had been spending far less time together of late. On this occasion, though, Ali was delighted to see him&#x2014;until she caught sight of the grim set of his jaw. Clearly, this was some other kind of visit.<br> <br>At another time in her life, Ali Reynolds might not have thought the worst, but after months of dealing with one disaster after another, her heart went to her throat. Had the brakes failed in her father&#x2019;s doddering antique Bronco, or had her mother&#x2019;s Alero been T-boned making a left-hand turn across traffic into the Sugarloaf Caf�&#x2019;s parking lot? Or was it Christopher? Had something happened to her son? Holding her breath, she gestured Dave onto the patio.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dave,&#x201d; she croaked. It was a lame attempt at pretending she wasn&#x2019;t terrified. &#x201c;Good to see you. Care for some tea?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dave shook his head. &#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d; He glanced toward the house. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Bryan Forester. Is he here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Relieved, Ali let out her breath. &#x201c;In the far bathroom,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Would you go find him, please?&#x201d; she said to Leland.<br> <br>Leland nodded. &#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; he said and marched away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; Ali asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x201d; Dave answered. &#x201c;Morgan Forester&#x2019;s been murdered. Their two girls came home from school a little while ago and found their mother dead in the front yard. Has Bryan been here all day?&#x201d;<br> <br>Even though all of Bryan&#x2019;s worker bees had shown up on time, Bryan himself hadn&#x2019;t appeared until later in the morning. Given that he had several different jobs going, his late arrival wasn&#x2019;t so unusual. Ali had noticed, however, that the generally even-tempered Bryan had seemed out of sorts. Even before his confrontation with the building inspector, Bryan had been barking at his people and growling at the guys wielding their cameras.<br> <br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t here all day,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But he was here most of it. Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Dave could ask anything more, Leland returned, bringing Bryan Forester with him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; Bryan asked, looking questioningly from Ali to Dave.<br> <br>Ali knew from personal experience what it meant to be given that kind of devastating news. Not wanting to witness Bryan Forester&#x2019;s heartbreak, Ali thought of taking Brooks and disappearing into the house. Before she could rise from the bench, however, Dave cut off that avenue of retreat by speaking immediately.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about your wife,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I have some very bad news.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad news about Morgan?&#x201d; Bryan asked. &#x201c;What about her? What kind of bad news. Has she been in a wreck or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to have to tell you this. Your wife has been murdered,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;Your daughters found her this afternoon when they came home from school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali felt a momentary flash of anger at Dave Holman. Couldn&#x2019;t he have found a gentler way of delivering such awful news? Couldn&#x2019;t he have couched it in less blunt terms?<br> <br>Bryan&#x2019;s face contorted in grief and astonishment as the brutal blow landed. He staggered over to the picnic table and sank down onto the redwood bench across the table from Ali. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, shaking his head from side to side in absolute denial. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be. It&#x2019;s impossible. Morgan was fine when I left for work. This is wrong. You must be mistaken.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid there&#x2019;s no mistake,&#x201d; Dave replied. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind, Mr. Forester, I&#x2019;ll need you to come with me. Once the body has been transported, we&#x2019;ll need you to identify...&#x201d;<br> <br>At first Ali thought he had softened slightly, but then she noticed the odd shift from &#x201c;Bryan&#x201d; to &#x201c;Mr. Forester.&#x201d; Ali was a year younger than Dave, and Bryan Forester was over ten years younger than Ali. Dave&#x2019;s turn to formality struck her as ominous.<br> <br>Bryan, on the other hand, seemed oblivious. He surged to his feet. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he interrupted. &#x201c;Where are Lindsey and Lacy? What have you done with my daughters? I&#x2019;ve got to see them, be with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The girls are fine,&#x201d; Dave said reassuringly. &#x201c;I called in Deputy Meecham, the DARE officer from their school. She knows your kids, and they know her. I asked her to take them to the sheriff&#x2019;s office. The girls are probably already there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, then,&#x201d; Bryan said impatiently, changing his mind about going to the house. &#x201c;Why are we standing around here jawing?&#x201d; He took two long strides toward Dave&#x2019;s car, then stopped and turned back to Ali. &#x201c;Tell the guys for me, please,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They should probably plan on taking the rest of the week off. Until I&#x2014;&#x201d; He broke off, unable to continue.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Ali said reassuringly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry about this, Bryan. You do what you need to do. We&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>She watched as Dave took Bryan Forester by the arm and escorted him to the waiting patrol car. Dave opened the door&#x2014;the door to the backseat, Ali noted, to let Bryan inside. Ali had to concede that was probably necessary, since there would likely be weapons and equipment in the front seat, but still, was it really necessary for Bryan to be locked in the back of the vehicle like a common criminal&#x2014;like he was under arrest or something? But then Ali remembered that when her almost&#x2013;ex husband, Paul Grayson, had been run over by a speeding freight in southern California, the investigating officers had driven her to Riverside in the back of a patrol car as well. Perhaps this was the same protocol and it meant nothing. Maybe Ali was simply reading too much into it.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like me to, madam,&#x201d; Leland Brooks said quietly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to track down the work crew and relay the bad news.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali knew that in the past, Leland had dealt with Arabella Ashcroft&#x2019;s periodic flights from sanity by retreating into that very proper butler mode. Dave&#x2019;s uncharacteristic detour into formality had disturbed her, but as Leland switched gears, Ali felt herself comforted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Ali said. &#x201c;That would be greatly appreciated.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali sat staring into the depths of her teacup and thought about two little girls coming home to the shock of finding their mother murdered. It appalled Ali to think about them being thrust into this awful turmoil and then being carted off to the sheriff&#x2019;s office by some stranger to await the arrival of their father.<br> <br>Ali&#x2019;s cell phone rang. Glad to be jolted out of her grim contemplations, she hurried to answer, but it didn&#x2019;t do her much good.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you heard about Morgan Forester?&#x201d; Edie Larson asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s positively dreadful! I still can&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali Reynolds had always marveled at her mother&#x2019;s uncanny ability to know everything that was going on in Sedona, Arizona, before almost anyone else did. Since Edie&#x2019;s sources were quick and nearly always accurate, Ali didn&#x2019;t bother questioning them now. Obviously, whoever had delivered the news knew what was going on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just did,&#x201d; Ali admitted. &#x201c;Dave was here a few minutes ago and told Bryan what had happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those poor sweet little girls,&#x201d; Edie went on. &#x201c;Can you imagine coming home from school and finding something like that? The one is already such an odd little duck, I doubt she&#x2019;ll ever recover.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Odd?&#x201d; Ali asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re twins, you know,&#x201d; Edie said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve come to the Sugarloaf on occasion, usually with their daddy.&#x201d; The Sugarloaf Caf� was the family-owned diner Ali&#x2019;s parents had run for years.<br> <br>&#x201c;The two of them are the cutest little things. They look just alike, but the one&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know which is which&#x2014;talks nonstop. She chatters on and on like a little magpie, while the other one never says a word. The one eats everything in sight and cleans her plate without the least bit of fuss. The other one has to have everything on a separate plate&#x2014;one plate for the eggs, another for the hash browns, another for the bacon, and still another for her toast or sweet roll. God forbid if one crumb of food should touch another. It&#x2019;s always a problem when they come in, because there&#x2019;s not enough room on our four-tops for one person to use four separate plates.&#x201d; Edie paused and then added, &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;ve never waited on them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Periodically, Ali pitched in as a substitute waitress. She knew of several adult customers with similar phobias, but she didn&#x2019;t remember ever waiting on Bryan Forester&#x2019;s little girls. &#x201c;I guess not,&#x201d; she agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m baking one of my tuna casseroles right now. Your dad will deliver it to their house a little later. I understand Bryan&#x2019;s folks moved down to Sun City a few years ago. His dad has arthritis, and the winters up here were too cold, but I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re on their way. I don&#x2019;t know about Morgan&#x2019;s folks. It seems to me they&#x2019;re not from around here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali didn&#x2019;t know anything about Morgan Forester&#x2019;s family. Wherever her parents lived, once they learned the news, their hearts, too, would be broken, but Ali suspected that no one from either side of the family would be very interested in Edie Larson&#x2019;s excellent tuna casserole.<br> <br>&#x201c;If the house is a crime scene, it&#x2019;ll be empty,&#x201d; Ali said quietly. &#x201c;No one will be allowed to be there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, of course,&#x201d; Edie said after a pause. &#x201c;Well, then, I&#x2019;ll talk to one of the neighbors and find out where your father should deliver the food once I have it ready. Now, what about Thanksgiving?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her seamless segue from tuna casserole to turkey and dressing left Ali momentarily confounded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you had your heart set on having everyone over to your new place,&#x201d; Edie continued. &#x201c;But we have to be realistic. That just isn&#x2019;t going to happen. We need a new plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>If Edie Larson had a sentimental bone in her body, her daughter...</p><h2>P.G.T.

He does all of this with the help of a hardworking, well-traveled staff of 100 at Rick Steves' Europe in Edmonds, Washington, near Seattle.

Original.</p><p>With another bleak vision of the zombie apocalypse, Keene makes a triumphant return to the still-thriving subgenre he helped revive with his 2004 debut <i>The Rising</i> (a movie version of which is currently in the works). Trouble begins when a virus infecting the rat population of New York City begins spreading among animals and humans alike&#x2014;one bite, one drop of blood or one string of saliva is all it takes to kill its victims, within minutes, and instantly revive them as mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Narrating this grim tale is gay 30-something Lamar Reed, who makes a hair-raising trip through the carnage of zombified Baltimore before he and a small group of survivors manage to commandeer a Coast Guard ship and get it out to sea. Together, the eclectic group search the coast for a safe harbor; meanwhile, an endless parade of zombies search the survivors' floating haven for a way in. Keene piles on the gory thrills as Lamar and his shipmates struggle through this diseased world, though they can be overly chatty at times (dialoging on everything from religion to Joseph Campbell). Delivering enough shudders and gore to satisfy any fan of the genre, Keene proves he's still a lead player in the zombie horror cavalcade. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Shortlisted for the CWA Historical Dagger Award 2018. It&#39;s business as usual for Mr Glossop as he does his regular round delivering wages to government buildings scattered across New Zealand&#39;s lonely Canterbury plains. But when his car breaks down he is stranded for the night at the isolated Mount Seager Hospital, with the telephone lines down, a storm on its way and the nearby river about to burst its banks. Trapped with him at Mount Seager are a group of quarantined soldiers with a serious case of cabin fever, three young employees embroiled in a tense love triangle, a dying elderly man, an elusive patient whose origins remain a mystery ... and a potential killer. When the payroll disappears from a locked safe and the hospital&#39;s death toll starts to rise faster than normal, can the appearance of an English detective working in counterespionage be just a lucky coincidence - or is something more sinister afoot?</p><p>Dame Ngaio Marsh was born in New Zealand in 1895. Along with Agatha Christie, Margery Allingham and Dorothy Sayers she was admired as one of the original `Queens of Crime&#39;, best known for her 32 crime novels featuring Detective Roderick Alleyn, published between 1934 and 1982, the year she died. In 1949 she had one million copies published on a single day (the &#39;Marsh Million&#39;), a distinction she shared only with George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells and Agatha Christie. Many of her stories have theatrical settings, reflecting Ngaio Marsh&#39;s real passion, and as both actress and producer she almost single-handedly revived the New Zealand public&#39;s interest in the theatre. It was for this work that the received what she called her `damery&#39; in 1966. Stella Duffy is an acclaimed novelist and theatremaker who has twice won a prestigious CWA Dagger for her short stories, she won Stonewall Writer of the Year twice and the inaugural Diva Literary Prize for Fiction in 2017. Born in London, she spent her childhood in New Zealand, has written 16 novels, and is the co-director of the Fun Palaces campaign for greater access to culture for all, and was awarded an OBE for services to the Arts in 2016.

Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p>Ken Kesey studied writing at Stanford University with Wallace Stegner and Malcolm Cowley.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b> The Critics Rave</b><br><br> The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br> NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b> The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br> As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br> Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b> Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br> The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America.

Now an adult, she resolves to return and exorcise her Carnival demons. She spends the week before Carnival in the area around Jacmel, exploring the rolling hills and lush forests and meeting the people who live and die in them. During her journeys she traces the heroic and tragic history of the island, from French colonists and Haitian revolutionaries to American invaders and home-grown dictators. Danticat also introduces us to many of the performers, artists, and organizers who re-create the myths and legends that bring the Carnival festivities to life. When Carnival arrives, we watch as she goes from observer to participant and finally loses herself in the overwhelming embrace of the crowd.<br><br>Part travelogue, part memoir, this is a lyrical narrative of a writer rediscovering her country along with a part of herself.

The carnival bands had completely taken over every meter of the square. As had previously been announced, the most renowned ones from the South East were there. The musicians and dancers seemed to be camped out for the moment amidst their sleeping instruments: different types of drums, bamboo horns, conch shells, rattles, saxophones, flutes, cones, accordions. Here and there, under the trees, while eating and drinking, the Jacmelians began to tell stories.</i><br>Rene Depestre, Hadriana dans tous mes reves<br><br><b>Jacmel 2001</b><br><br>"Carnival Country"<br><br>During carnival Jacmel is not a town or a city. It is a country," Michelet Divers, Jacmel's best-known carnival expert, tells me over a tall glass of lemonade on the airy terrace of the Hotel de la Place, a three-story, white Victorian-style restaurant, bar, souvenir shop, and hotel in the Bel-Air section of Jacmel. The terrace has an eye-level view of a flamboyant-filled piazza, where young men straddle the low colonnaded walls to watch the bustling human and automobile traffic stream by.<br><br>I am here for my first national carnival. Since 1992, Divers explains, Jacmel has been hosting two carnivals on consecutive weekends, the national one, which draws people from all over Haiti and the Haitian diaspora, and the local one, which is primarily attended by the residents of Jacmel.<br><br>Everyone I have spoken to about my intention to attend the national carnival festivities this coming Sunday has recommended that I first speak to Divers. A stocky forty-seven-year-old with dark, wide-rimmed glasses, Divers is a radio commentator and former school principal. He is quick to point out that he is not the one who came up with the idea of temporary sovereignty for Jacmel, but that other Jacmelians would like to see the image of the southern coastal town of ten thousand, the Riviera of Haiti, the Ibiza of the Caribbean--as the Haitian tourist guides say--detached from the one that outsiders have of the rest of the country, particularly the capital, Port-au-Prince: dirt-poor, politically troubled, and certainly lacking any celebrations.<br><br>"Jacmel is not like that," says Divers, "especially during carnival."<br><br>A Jacmelian "by birth and choice," Divers has written a book about the Jacmel carnivals (Le Carnaval Jacmelien) and this year is the cultural adviser for both. This means that he, along with other members of the carnival committee, gets to decide which musical bands, costumed groups, individuals, and animals will be allotted a coveted spot in Sunday's colorful street parade.<br><br>I do not mention it to Divers, but this is the first time that I will be an active reveler at carnival in Haiti. I am worried that such an admission would appear strange to someone for whom carnival is one of life's passions. A Haitian writer (me)--even one who'd left the country twenty years before, at age twelve--who has never been to carnival in her own country? I imagine him asking. What was that about?<br><br>As a child living in Haiti with my Baptist minister uncle and his wife, while my parents settled in as new immigrants in New York City, I had never been allowed to "join the carnival," as the Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean urged many to do in his 1997 Carnival album. I was too young (under twelve), small for my age, and we lived in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital, coincidentally--and in much contrast to this area of Jacmel--also called Bel-Air. Long pre-Lent days of unbridled dancing, with clammy bodies pressed either against each other or within a few inches of the giant wheels of flatbed trucks serving as floats, were considered not safe for me. However, since I had as intense a desire to join the carnival as some peculiar American children have of joining the circus, my uncle for years spun frightening tales around it to keep me away.<br><br>People always hurt themselves during carnival, he said, and it was their fault, for gyrating with so much abandon that they would dislocate their hips and shoulders and lose their voices while singing too loudly. People went deaf, he said, from the clamor of immense speakers blasting live music from the floats to the viewing stands and the surrounding neighborhoods. Not only could one be punched, stabbed, pummeled, or shot during carnival, either by random hotheads or by willful villains who were taking advantage of their anonymity in a crowd of thousands to settle old scores, but young girls could be freely fondled, squeezed like sponges by dirty old, and not so old, men. Or they could be forced to participate in a maryaj pou dis, a "ten-cent or ten-minute marriage," that is, acting as if they were wed while simulating sex with a total stranger. And while we were in the realm of dangerous liaisons, there was also the possibility that a person who appeared quite normal and attractive during carnival was not a human being at all, but a demon. Besides, for the first twelve years of my life, Haiti was ruled by the dictatorship of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude. A military presence at public events was imperative, which made the streets that much more hazardous. At carnival, there were always militiamen and soldiers clubbing people over the head with sticks or rifle butts.<br><br>To spare me all this, my uncle would take me and the other residents of his household on a religious retreat in the mountains of Leogane, the birthplace of my grandparents, where we would spend the carnival week helping relatives feed their livestock and work their land. Some of my relatives in the mountains were also known to sing raunchy songs and tell ribald jokes about wives who temporarily divorced their husbands and abandoned their young children so they could be free to fully enjoy carnival; however, it was my uncle's stories that kept me away from carnival celebrations in Haiti for years.<br><br>Even after I thought I had forgotten my uncle's tales, I developed a mild fear of being buried alive in too large a crowd, hyperventilating whenever I felt that a wall of people had grown so dense around me that I would not be able to leave. Later, as an adult in New York, I would faint at demonstrations, having to be carried over people's heads like a heatstroke victim at a rock concert.<br><br>Once when I was in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, a friend talked me into jumping into a crowd of carnival revelers when the crowd was at its most impenetrable, squeezing through a narrow street in the middle of the night. I nearly got my head bashed in by a long line of military policemen who suddenly parted the multitudes with swinging batons and nightsticks in order to force a car through.<br><br>That night in Salvador, I had done my best to stay on my feet, which was the advice I had gotten before entering the crowd--drop and people will trample you--and I had landed on a sidewalk not knowing how I had gotten there, but hearing echoes of my uncle's cautionary tales throbbing in my head.<br><br>So I avoided carnival, except as a distant observer, watching videotapes sold in Haitian music stores in Brooklyn, weeks after the festivities had ended, and marveling at the revelers' ability to surrender to the sway of so many others, release themselves temporarily from personal and global concerns: the ever present economic and political worries of the country and, in the case of some of the women of Leog*ne, the shackles of matrimony and the staunch warnings of fearful relatives who wanted to keep them at home.<br><br>Now it was the same fear evoked by my uncle's stories that had drawn me to the carnival festivities in Jacmel. I was aching for a baptism by crowd here, among my own people. I wanted to confront the dual carnival demons, which I had been so carefully taught to fear: the earsplitting music and the unbridled dancing amid a large group of people, whose inhibitions were sometimes veiled by costumes and masks.<br><br>As a child with secret artistic aspirations, I was always drawn to masks. There is an image from ancient Greek theater that I have always liked, a mask with half a laughing face and half a sorrowful one. This mask has always seemed to me a representation of the country where I was born, especially during carnival. Haitians, like the ancient Greek comedians, have always balanced their tragedies with laughter, using distressing situations as the subject of satirical songs and jest. I have also always linked the French expression jeter le masque, which means to show one's true colors, to Haitian carnival, imagining carnival as one intense moment during which so many colors are shed that each person walks in the street parade with a rainbow above his or her head.<br><br>I was still wearing my own mask of distant observer with Divers, so I didn't tell him any of this. It was only later that I would even learn to verbalize it. Sitting there with him on the Hotel de la Place terrace, I could only think of queries and quizzes for him, questions about Jacmel in general and carnival in particular.<br><br>Only a few feet from Jacmel's city hall and municipal library, the Hotel de la Place serves as a gathering spot for travelers as well as locals. It is one of many such localities around town where people sit on a terrace to talk, have a drink, and watch the street. On the walls inside are pictures of locally known natives, artists, politicians, and writers, the most quoted of which is the moon-faced and bald-headed Professor Jean Claude, who is best known for having written that there are only two great cities in the world: Paris and Jacmel. Around the bar are also photographs of the city before the many storms and fires that have forced it to be modified and rebuilt over the years. The Hotel de la Place, and the terrace where Divers and I are sitting, was once part of a family-run boardinghouse called the Pension Craft, before it burned down in the 1990s and was rebuilt as a hotel.<br><br>Divers chose the Hotel de la Place terrace for our meeting because he's waiting to be called to nearby city hall for a carnival-preparation session.<br><br>From the terrace, Divers turns his face to the street to respond to nods and hellos from passersby as he tells me, "In reality, the carnival in Jacmel begins the first Sunday in January and ends on Mardi Gras, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. That is officially the length of the carnival season, and during that time, Jacmel is carnival country. Every Sunday during the carnival season, people come out in costume, individually or in groups. However, the national carnival, which you will see on Sunday, is a summary of all of that. Yes, it is a parade, an exposition, but it is also a way for Jacmel to tell its story. Every costume, every mask portrays a part of our story and concerns."<br><br>"How many people are you expecting on Sunday?" I ask.<br><br>"Last year we had over twenty thousand," he says.<br><br>Divers has traveled to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to give lectures and to host presentations and demonstrations of Jacmel's carnival. While he is trying to recall a future date for a conference abroad, he is interrupted by a passerby who wishes to ask him a question.<br><br>"Will the mule with the tennis shoes be part of Sunday's parade?" an old man wants to know.<br><br>Divers assures the concerned reveler that yes, the mule will indeed be present. There had been a small dispute when the carnival committee and the mayor's office, which gives a stipend to all the carnival acts based on their relative needs, tried to reduce funding for the mule. The owner of the mule protested by saying, "People must think it's easy getting those kid-sized sneakers on four hoofs."<br><br>Imagining the labor alone, Divers laughs, he encouraged the carnival committee to keep the mule's funding the same.<br><br>Divers cannot speak about what other carnival repeaters will present out on Jacmel's main road, the Baranquilla, in a few days. He is bound to secrecy because part of the fun leading up to Sunday's parade will be guessing what the groups will come up with.<br><br>Max Power, the carnival club that was a huge hit last year with a parade of papier-mache faces of famous world figures, forcing Adolf Hitler to march side by side with Mother Teresa, Albert Einstein, Bob Marley, and Haiti's own deceased dictator Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, has two spots on the parade roster this year. First Max Power will repeat last year's performance with the same celebrities, and a few more yet to be named; then the members will change costumes and return with their piece de resistance, which is sure to blow everyone away. If Divers knows what Max Power's magnum opus will be, he is not telling.<br><br>"The carnival must have at least one revelation," he says, "an element of surprise."</p><h2>Dance in the Vampire Bund, Vol. 1</h2><p><p>The most original vampire story in centuries! </p><p>After millennia in hiding, Mina Tepes, the princess of the ancient covenant and ruler of all vampires, wants change.

It is one of a series of short essays on spirituality from Sufi teacher Hazrat Inayat Khan, who journeyed from India to spread his message of love and spiritual liberty to the West. The essay describes the Sufi ideas of God, nature, truth, and love, among others, as well as a beginners guide to Sufism. This work is ideal for anyone interested in world religions, learning about Sufi beliefs, or studying the spread of Sufism in the 20th century. HAZRAT INAYAT KHAN (1882-1927) was a Sufi teacher and writer who founded the &#34;Sufi Order in the West&#34; in London in 1914. Born into a Muslim-Indian noble family, he was initiated into several Sufi orders before leaving India in 1910 as a traveling musician at the encouragement of his sheik. Once arriving in the West, Khan turned from music to spreading Sufi thought and practice throughout three continents. He returned to India in 1926 to choose a site for his burial. Today, he is remembered for his call to man to awake to &#34;Truth of Divine Guidance and Love,&#34; which is resonant in his many works on Universal Sufism.</p><p>Inayat Khan was an exemplar of Universal Sufism and founder of the &#34;Sufi Order in the West&#34; in 1914 (London). Later, in 1923, the Sufi Order of the London period was dissolved into a new organization formed under Swiss law and called the &#34;International Sufi Movement&#34;. He initially came to the West as a representative of classical Indian music, having received the title Tansen from the Nizam of Hyderabad but soon turned to the introduction and transmission of Sufi thought and practice. His universal message of divine unity (Tawhid) focused on the themes of love, harmony and beauty. He taught that blind adherence to any book rendered any religion void of spirit.</p><h2>The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition</h2><p><i>The Communist Manifesto</i>,is the most influential political call-to-arms ever written. In the century and a half since its publication the world has been shaken repeatedly by those who sought to make its declamations a reality.<br><br>But the focus of this modern edition is not primarily the vivid history of Marx and Engels&#x2019; most important work. Rather, with a characteristically elegant and acute introduction by the distinguished historian Eric Hobsbawm, it asserts the pertinence of the <i>Manifesto</i> today.<br><br>Hobsbawm writes that &#x2018;the world described by Marx and Engels in 1848 in passages of dark, laconic eloquence, is recognizably the world we live in 150 years later.&#x2019; He identifies the insights which underpin the Manifesto&#x2019;s startling contemporary relevance: the recognition of capitalism as a world system capable of marshalling production on a global scale; its devastating impact on all aspects of human existence, work, the family and the distribution of wealth; and the understanding that, far from being a stable, immutable system, it is, on the contrary, susceptible to enormous convulsions and crisis, and contains the seeds of its own destruction.<br><br>For anyone skeptical of the triumphalism of the financial markets in recent years, who chooses to focus instead on the growing global divergence of rich and poor, the ravaging of the environment and the atomization of society, the <i>Manifesto</i> will appear as a work of extraordinary prescience and power.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>Betty Parsons: Artist, Dealer, Collector</h2><p>Recounts the life and career of the woman who brought Abstract Expressionism into the full view of the art world</p><p>The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened its doors in Manhattan in 1946, quickly became the flagship of abstract expressionism, championing works by Rothko, Pollock et al. Its owner was a determined woman who had rebelled against her New York society family and had divorced a dictatorial husband to seek her fortune as an artist in 1920s and '30s Paris and Hollywood, where she had numerous lesbian affairs. With an eye for originality, Parsons (1900-1982) showcased Joseph Cornell, Barnett Newman and Saul Steinberg. She served as a muse in the "he-man's macho game" of abstract expressionism, all the while craving recognition as a painter and sculptor in her own right. (Regrettably, only one or two examples of her own work are shown here) Tennis partner of Greta Garbo, friend of Janet Flanner and Alexander Calder in Paris, Parsons led a charmed existence, and this richly illustrated biographical profile by a longtime friend captures her many-faceted, whirlwind life. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cruel Winter: A County Cork Mystery</h2><p>Snow is a rarity in Maura Donovan's small village in County Cork, Ireland, so she wasn't sure what to expect when a major snowstorm rolled in around Sullivan's pub.

The whir of the oxygen machine in the corner ricocheted off the tiled floor, providing the only constant sound in the space. Bookshelves and a dresser near her bed were laden with statues of saints, an oversized Child Jesus, religious cards, and relics. And there, bundled in a hospital bed, beneath a faded painting of the wounded Savior, a white ski cap atop her head, lay the most powerful and influential woman in Catholicism: the indomitable Mother Angelica<br><br>As late as 2010, although she was bedridden and weakened by a stroke, the old nun&#x2019;s spunk remained intact. I walked into Mother&#x2019;s cell one afternoon to find her tugging the bedsheets up over her mouth, engaged in a daily war.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, you have to eat if you want to stay strong and healthy,&#x201d; the tiny Vietnamese nun, Sister Gabriel,&nbsp;fussed, extending a spoonful of mashed potatoes toward Mother&#x2019;s face. Angelica, having none of it, turned her glance toward the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she trying to force-feed you again?&#x201d; I jokingly asked as I entered.<br><br>Mother smiled broadly, tilting her face toward Sister Gabriel&#x2019;s spoon, and lowered the bed linen. Then just as the food approached, she yanked the sheet up again blocking the potatoes&#x2019; entry.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Mother,&#x201d; Sister Gabriel said in frustration. Delighting in the mayhem, Angelica let loose a wheezy cackle for my benefit. She winked at me and then having had her fun, quickly opened her mouth to accept the first morsel of lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;She always gives me a hard time with lunch. Don&#x2019;t you, Mother?&#x201d; Sister Gabriel said, offering a second scoop of potatoes. Mother pursed her lips and slowly shook her head from side to side. Lunch was over.<br><br>The moment struck me as classic Mother Angelica: the steely will, the slightly subversive humor, the joy that millions all over the globe had come to love were on full display for anyone entering that overheated room. I was partly to blame for the show. Sister Catherine, the onetime vicar of Our Lady of the Angels Monastery, claimed that Mother would &#x201c;perform&#x201d; when I showed up. It was as if she remembered the fun we had in days gone by and wanted to let me know that she was still game&#x2014;her disability be damned.<br><br>My regular visits with Mother Mary Angelica never really ended. The frequency of our personal meetings was impeded by her stroke and her eventual confinement to the cell, but they continued&#x2014;vastly altered&#x2014; right up until her passing.<br><br>Mother Angelica hired me as news director at EWTN in 1996 and over time became much more than an employer to me. I cohosted her Mother Angelica Live program for a few years, and we often had long personal conversations at the end of the workday or after the live shows on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. While I was working on her biography, from 1999 to 2001, we&#x2019;d meet every Saturday in her monastery parlor, peering at each other through the wrought-iron latticework separating the world from the cloister. During those intense interviews she could be explosive, hilarious, conspiratorial, and holy&#x2014;at times all at once. With Italianate gusto she shared how a tenacious faith reshaped the life of a wounded girl from Canton, Ohio, and changed the world.<br><br>In the lusterless suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, this crippled nun, who barely graduated high school, founded a cable network in her cloister garage in 1981. She would tend the fledging operation for two decades, crossing swords with errant bishops, beating back takeover attempts, and struggling with her own infirmity to make the Eternal Word Television Network the largest religious media organization on the planet. It was her&nbsp;personality&#x2014;her particular ability to connect with viewers and spiritually console them in moments of distress&#x2014; that propelled the thing forward. They could feel her faith and were warmed by it. Away from the cameras, it was Mother Angelica&#x2019;s mystical intimacy with pain and suffering that fueled EWTN&#x2019;s growth and made her one of the world&#x2019;s most beloved spiritual figures.<br><br>The rigid white headgear of her habit could barely contain the nun&#x2019;s expressive face as she related the dramatic turns in her life during our times together. With each interview my understanding of her deepened along with our friendship. At times Mother would get so comfortable, especially over shared meals, that she would shift her weight in the overstuffed leather parlor chair, place a long, lean hand against her face, and really open up. She&#x2019;d share troubles and fears, intimacies and secrets restricted to only a few of her sisters.<br><br>In June 2001 our conversation turned to some bishops who had caused her heartache in the past, men who never really cared for Mother&#x2019;s spiritual emphasis or style: &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t pay me any attention. They&#x2019;re just waiting for me to die. But I won&#x2019;t! Ha ha.&#x201d; Her eyes twinkled with mischief; a satisfied smile spread across her face. Then she exhaled and suddenly the mood changed. &#x201c;I talked to the Lord recently,&#x201d; she confided in a hush, &#x201c;and I said I would like to stay until the worst is over&#x2014;for the Church, for the community.&#x201d;<br><br>The Lord accepted her proposal. But I doubt if even Mother could foresee the consequences of her request.<br><br>Later that year, on Christmas Eve, a stroke precipitated by a cerebral hemorrhage nearly killed Angelica, depriving her of the speech that had built her broadcast empire. In 2004, an injury would shrink her world, physically restricting her to a corner bedroom at Our Lady of the Angels Monastery. To outsiders, and even to some of her closest collaborators, it would appear Mother Angelica&#x2019;s story was over. The old abbess became ill, was shut up in her room, and waited for God to come for her. But there is much more to the story&#x2014;a story that has been hidden from the public until now.<br><br>In her protracted silence&#x2014;for more than a decade&#x2014; Mother Angelica would struggle for her soul, fight for her religious community, see the fulfillment of her last mission, and radically transform the lives of people she had never known. She would indeed stay until the worst was over.<br><br>Our society has a tendency to ignore or diminish the value of the infirm and the frail elderly. Their suffering and physical debilitation are reminders of our own mortality and the last act that awaits us all. But as the lives of Blessed Mother Teresa and Saint Pope John Paul II teach us, the end can be the most efficacious part of a life. It is a time of weakness and physical hardship, but it can also be one of spiritual union with God. For those striving for holiness, the &#x201c;last things&#x201d; can include supernatural attacks&#x2014;temptations to doubt after a lifetime of belief. Mother was no exception. As I spoke to the sisters who cared for Mother, I learned details about her&nbsp;last years that even those closest to the monastery could not fathom.<br><br>In these pages are the particulars of Mother&#x2019;s 2004 secret journey to the Far East, a trip that would cost her dearly; firsthand, in-depth revelations of her physical struggles and the abiding faith that sustained her&#x2014;even through the upheaval of her own religious community; accounts of the supernatural phenomena surrounding Mother in her last days and the spiritual warfare she waged in her cell; as well as intimate stories of her early years never before seen in print.<br><br>When I reviewed the three years of interviews I had conducted with Mother&#x2014;her final interviews&#x2014;I came across things I didn&#x2019;t know existed, or had overlooked as I was writing the biography. Mother&#x2019;s unpublished words shed new light on her painful final years, and put them in astonishing perspective. Having written an exhaustive biography of Mother Angelica and edited three volumes of her teachings and prayers, I thought I had written my last Mother Angelica book. My intention was to compose an epilogue for the biography consisting of a few details of her last days with some excerpts from our interviews and leave it at that. But when I sat down to write, so much new material emerged that another book presented itself.<br><br>Equally as fascinating as the facts surrounding Mother&#x2019;s last years are the many lives she influenced during her long public absence. Via reruns on EWTN,&nbsp;Mother continued (and continues) to be a part of our lives. Though her live television career was long over, the heart of her ministry&#x2014;pain and suffering offered up for the good of others&#x2014;continued unimpeded in her final cloistered years. Gathered here is the fruit of her labors: the personal testimonies of many people scattered throughout the world whom she reached spiritually from a monastery bed in Hanceville, Alabama.&nbsp;<br><br>This work also permits me a chance to reflect on my personal relationship with Mother Angelica, something I have never written about before.<br><br>What follows is the conclusion of Mother&#x2019;s biography, a synopsis of her life leading up to this work, my personal account of our loving friendship, and a tribute to a cherished spiritual icon.<br><br>Attentive readers will notice that EWTN is mentioned only in passing here, as it had little connection to Mother in her final years. Following her resignation in 2000 and full withdrawal in 2001, she had no input into the day-to-day affairs of the network, nor was she or her sisters involved in the administration. That said, the spiritual ties to EWTN ran deep, and Mother always considered the network part of a personal mission entrusted to her alone.</p><h2>Pattern (Scavenger Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b>'...indescribably addictive.

One of the greatest tragedies of the twentieth century, the famine is poorly understood, and in China is still euphemistically referred to as the three years of natural disaster. As a journalist with privileged access to official and unofficial sources, Yang Jisheng spent twenty years piecing together the events that led to mass nationwide starvation, including the death of his own father. Finding no natural causes, Yang lays the deaths at the feet of China s totalitarian system and the refusal of officials at every level to value human life over ideology and self-interest.

The Chinese Communist Party&#x2019;s &#x201c;Three Red Banners&#x201d; waved highest here, and the famine likewise hit hardest. Political movements set off the famine in Henan. Some seventy thousand Henan residents were labeled &#x201c;rightists&#x201d; in 1957&#x2014;nearly 13 percent of those targeted in the Anti-Rightist Movement nationwide, and 15 percent of the province&#x2019;s cadres.1 In 1958 a new campaign was launched against the &#x201c;Pan, Yang, Wang rightist anti-party clique&#x201d; within the party, which will be detailed later in this chapter.2 These two campaigns combined to create dread and fanaticism that led to wild exaggeration and horrendous brutality that in turn brought about a series of catastrophes&#x2014;among which the &#x201c;Xinyang Incident&#x201d; is the most notable. <br>PART I: THE XINYANG INCIDENT <br>Xinyang Prefecture lies in the southeast of Henan, bordering the provinces of Hubei and Anhui. In 1958 the prefecture administered eighteen counties, the city of Xinyang, and the town of Zhumadian. It was home to 8.5 million people. Most of the prefecture consisted of mountain ranges that had served as bases for China&#x2019;s revolutionary forces, and where hundreds of thousands of lives had been sacrificed in the civil war with the Kuomintang. Elderly residents say, &#x201c;Even the trees and grasses of the Dabie Mountains served the Communist Party.&#x201d; This lush region was the province&#x2019;s main producer of grain and cotton and an abundant source of tea leaves, timber, bamboo, tung oil, and medicinal herbs. Scenic Jigong Shan (Rooster Mountain) is located here. In short, Xinyang, along with nearby Nanyang and Luoyang, was the economic engine of the province. Yet from the winter of 1959 to the spring of 1960, at least one million people starved to death here&#x2014;one out of every eight residents. <br>Li Jian, an official of the CCP Central Control Commission (the precursor of the Discipline and Inspection Commission) sent to Henan in the wake of the famine, found that the largest number of starvation deaths occurred in Xinyang and two other prefectures: Nanyang and Xuchang. The most horrific situation became known as the &#x201c;Xinyang Incident.&#x201d;3 <br>In September 1999, I went to Xinyang, accompanied by a senior reporter from Xinhua&#x2019;s Henan branch, Gu Yuezhong, and a former Xinhua reporter who had been stationed in Xinyang during the famine, Lu Baoguo. Gu had excellent relations with local officials, but the Xinyang municipal party committee was clearly disconcerted by the purpose of our visit, and arranged a scenic tour of Rooster Mountain. Nonetheless, we managed to interview a number of cadres and villagers who had lived through the famine, and gained access to a number of documents that shed light on the Xinyang Incident. <br>POLITICAL PRESSURE BREEDS EXAGGERATION <br>In a political system such as China&#x2019;s, those below imitate those above, and political struggles at the higher levels are replicated at the lower levels in an expanded and even more ruthless form. This is what happened in Xinyang. <br>Following the provincial-level campaign against the &#x201c;Pan, Yang, Wang&#x201d; clique and the campaign against right deviation, Xinyang&#x2019;s Guangshan County on November 11, 1959, conducted a criticism, or &#x201c;struggle,&#x201d; session against the secretary of the CCP county secretariat, Zhang Fuhong, who was labeled a &#x201c;right deviationist&#x201d; and a &#x201c;degenerate element.&#x201d; During the struggle session, county party secretary Ma Longshan took the lead by kicking Zhang, after which others set upon him with fists and feet. Other struggle sessions were conducted by county-level cadres on November 13 and 14, during which Zhang was beaten bloody, his hair ripped out in patches, and his uniform torn to shreds, leaving him barely able to walk. <br>On November 15, Zhang was handed over to commune cadres, by which time he could only lie on the floor while he was kicked and punched and had what remained of his hair torn out. Another struggle session by commune cadres on November 16 left Zhang near death; by the time he was dragged home that day, he had lost control of his bodily functions and could no longer eat or drink. On November 17 he was accused of malingering and attacked again. On November 18 he was accused of pining for the return of Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek and was dragged from his bed for more struggle. When he asked for water, he was refused. Around noon on November 19, Zhang Fuhong died.4 <br>Xinyang&#x2019;s deputy party secretary and prefectural commissioner, Zhang Shufan, subsequently related in his memoirs why Zhang Fuhong was targeted. In the spring of 1959, in order to alleviate famine conditions among the peasants, Ma Longshan sent Zhang Fuhong to a production team to launch a pilot project in which output quotas were assigned to each household. Other localities were doing the same, but following the political reversals of the Central Committee&#x2019;s Lushan Conference,5 household output quotas were labeled right opportunism. Ma denied responsibility, saying Zhang Fuhong had initiated the use of quotas. Although Zhang insisted that Ma had assigned him to carry out the system,6 an official one level higher can crush his subordinate, and that is what happened here. <br>Campaigns against right deviation in other counties were similarly brutal. In Xi County, party secretary Xu Xilan directed a struggle session against deputy secretary Feng Peiran. Xu sat above Feng with a handgun at his side while someone held Feng by the neck as others beat and kicked him. According to Zhang Shufan&#x2019;s memoirs, some twelve thousand struggle sessions were held in the prefecture,7 and all kinds of ridiculous statements were made under political pressure. <br>In 1958, Xinyang&#x2019;s Suiping County was given nationwide publicity for Great Leap production successes referred to as Sputniks, or &#x201c;satellites.&#x201d; These &#x201c;grand achievements&#x201d; were attributed to the &#x201c;struggle against right-deviating conservatism.&#x201d; In an atmosphere of extreme political pressure, anyone who dared question the accuracy of these reported crop yields risked being labeled a &#x201c;doubter&#x201d; or &#x201c;denier&#x201d; engaged in &#x201c;casting aspersions on the excellent situation,&#x201d; and anyone who exposed the fraudulence of the high-yield model was subjected to struggle. <br>A drought in 1959 drove down Xinyang&#x2019;s crop yields, but prefectural party cadres, overcome by fanaticism, proposed the slogan of &#x201c;Big drought, big harvest&#x201d; and claimed higher yields than the year before. Commissioner Zhang Shufan, who was directly responsible for agriculture, in early August convened a meeting of leading county cadres to provide &#x201c;practical and realistic&#x201d; appraisals of the disaster and to adopt advanced measures such as varied crop plantings to prevent a famine. <br>Following the Lushan Conference, the prefectural party committee had each county report its projected yields. Under the political pressure of the times, each county&#x2019;s estimate was exceeded by that of the next, as all feared being criticized for reporting the lowest projection. Yu Dehong, a staff member at the prefectural party committee meeting, later recalled that the first projection totaled 15 billion kilos. Zhang Shufan and others thought this excessively optimistic and asked everyone to submit new figures, which subsequently totaled 7.5 billion kilos and finally 3.6 billion kilos. During a meeting of the prefectural party committee&#x2019;s standing committee, eight of the nine standing committee members believed that the 1959 crop yield would exceed that of 1958, and that given the 1958 yield of 2.8 billion kilos, a 3.6 billion kilo yield for 1959 was very reasonable. Zhang Shufan, however, expected a yield of only 1.5 to 2.0 billion kilos. <br>In late August and early September, the Henan provincial party committee convened an enlarged meeting to implement the spirit of the Lushan Conference. Each prefecture was asked to report projected crop yields. Zhang Shufan led off for Xinyang by reporting that his standing committee projected a crop yield of 3.6 billion kilos, but that his more modest personal projection was 1.5 to 2 billion kilos. The provincial party committee was dissatisfied with Zhang&#x2019;s report and subsequently asked prefectural party secretary Lu Xianwen, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on in Xinyang?&#x201d; Under pressure, Lu convened another meeting of county party secretaries requesting new projections. At first no one spoke, but finally someone asked, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it what we already reported in our meeting?&#x201d; Lu Xianwen replied, &#x201c;Someone took exception to those projections.&#x201d; By &#x201c;someone,&#x201d; Lu was referring to Zhang Shufan. Soon afterward, right-deviating elements were sought out and subjected to struggle, and this county head who had dared to speak the truth was stripped of his official position.8 <br>PROCUREMENT BASED ON ABSURD PROJECTIONS <br>Exaggerated yield projections meant high state procurement quotas. In Henan, every county was forced to hand over every available kernel of grain. Zhang Shufan recalls: <br>Following the expanded meeting, I returned to the prefecture to head up the autumn harvest procurement. The provincial party committee based its procurement on the big 1958 harvest, and our prefecture met our quota of 800 million kilos by taking every kernel of grain ration and seed grain from the peasants. Immediately after the harvest, many localities were left with nothing to eat, and people began to leave the prefecture in search of food. Many communal kitchens had no food to serve their members, and the helpless villagers staved their hunger at home as best they could with sweet potatoes and wild herbs. <br>Higher levels reported a somewhat smaller procurement quota, but agreed that excessive procurement had serious repercussions: <br>In 1959, Xinyang suffered a drought. The total grain yield of the prefecture was less than 1.63 billion kilos, a decrease of 46.1 percent from 1958, but the prefectural party committee projected a grain yield of more than 3.21 billion kilos. On that basis, the province set Xinyang&#x2019;s procurement quota at 480 million kilos, which was 21.5 million kilos more than in 1958. The prefectural party committee added 5 percent to the procurement quota for each county, raising the total procurement quota to 502.45 million kilos. After the prefecture met its quota, the food ration left after seed grain and fodder were excluded was only 82.25 kilos of unprocessed grain per person for the year. Based on typical consumption of 17.5 kilos per person per month, that was enough to feed the population for four months. With no supplementary foodstuffs or oil, the 17.5 kilos of unprocessed grain amounted to 12.5 kilos of edible grain, barely enough to prevent starvation. In addition, some 1.8 million people were engaged in irrigation projects in the prefecture, and they alone consumed a large share of the available grain.9 <br>The Henan provincial party committee subsequently found, <br>Last year the autumn yield of the entire prefecture of Xinyang was estimated at only a little more than 1 billion kilos, but was exaggerated to 3.2 billion kilos, and the province set the prefecture&#x2019;s procurement quota at 480 million kilos, with additional procurements at the prefecture, county, and commune levels increasing the procurement quota by more than 20 percent. After the prefecture met its mid-October procurement quota of more than 350 million kilos, 3,751 communal kitchens (370,000 people) were left without food. Even under those conditions, the campaign against false underreporting of output and of widespread private withholding of foodstuffs continued in all communes and production teams.10 <br>As this campaign gained force, it exacerbated the famine. <br>In 1958, Xinyang Prefecture organized about 30 percent of the prefecture&#x2019;s working population for the great iron and steel production campaign.11 The steel furnaces didn&#x2019;t actually smelt any iron; rather, the woks and cooking utensils of the peasants, the door knockers from their homes, and the bells from temples were all melted down in order to report success. In addition to the 1.2 million laborers used for this campaign, more than half a million were engaged in ball bearing production, and another 2.0 million in irrigation projects.12 Feeding these laborers left that much less grain for the farm production teams. <br>THE VIOLENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST FALSE REPORTING OF OUTPUT <br>Excessively high requisition quotas made procurement difficult. If farmers were unable to hand over the required amount, the government would accuse production teams of concealing grain. A &#x201c;struggle between the two roads&#x201d; (of socialism and capitalism) was launched to counteract the alleged withholding of grain. This campaign used political pressure, mental torture, and ruthless violence to extort every last kernel of grain or seed from the peasants. Anyone who uttered the slightest protest was beaten, sometimes fatally. <br>A meeting at Rooster Mountain pushed the campaign against grain hoarding to a climax. Li Ruiying, the wife of Zhang Shufan, was chair of Xinyang Prefecture&#x2019;s Federation of Women. In June 1959 the prefectural party committee had her lead a work group to Rooster Mountain Commune to report on a pilot project to produce 5,000 kilos of paddy per <i>mu</i> of land, the brainchild of the county party secretary. Li Ruiying&#x2019;s team stayed at Rooster Mountain for a month, during which they learned that this model commune was a fraud and that the peasants there were starving. Li wrote to prefectural party secretary Lu Xianwen requesting 105,000 kilos of grain, but Lu refused and labeled Li Ruiying a right deviationist. A cadre sent to Rooster Mountain to replace Li also truthfully reported the hunger of commune members, only to be labeled a &#x201c;vacillator.&#x201d; <br>Li&#x2019;s replacement, Wang Binglin, tried to appease party secretary Lu Xianwen by organizing an on-the-spot meeting to oppose &#x201c;false reporting of output and private withholding,&#x201d; the arcane official formulation for hoarding. All that was produced were rice husks covered by a thin layer of grain. The prefectural party committee ordered local cadres to stifle the public outcry, stop villagers from fleeing in search of food, and halt the closure of communal kitchens. After that, anyone who claimed to have no grain was labeled a &#x201c;negator of the Three Red Banners,&#x201d; a &#x201c;negator of the Great Harvest,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;right deviationist,&#x201d; and was subjected to struggle. If communal kitchens closed due to lack of food, this was labeled &#x201c;the masses threatening the cadres,&#x201d; and abandoning starving children along the roadsides was labeled &#x201c;an assault against the party.&#x201d;13 <br>Punishments were inflicted on cadres and villagers alike. In Guangshan County, 2,241 people were beaten, 105 fatally, and 526 cadres were stripped of their official positions. The number of deaths from physical abuse rose even higher toward the end of the campaign. In <i>The Xinyang Incident</i>, Qiao Peihua describes the situation in one village: <br>At the end of September 1959, Wang Pinggui, a member of the Wangxiaowan production team, was forced to hand over grain kept in his home, and was beaten with a shoulder pole, dying of his injuries five days later. Not long after Wang&#x2019;s death, the rest of his four-member household died of starvation. <br>In October 1959, Luo Mingzhu of the Luowan production team, upon failing to hand over any grain, was bound and suspended in mid-air and beaten, then doused with ice-cold water. He died the next day. <br>On October 13, 1959, Wang Taishu of the Chenwan production team, upon failing to hand over any grain, was bound and beaten with shoulder poles and rods, dying four days later.

He was a loner who owned nothing but his horse and saddle-and his guns. He was a man willing to gamble his life to get the woman he wanted... He was Shalako.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour</b> has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and women who settled the frontier. There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print around the world.Chapter 1<br><br>For seven days in the spring of 1882 the man called Shalako heard no sound but the wind. . . .<br><br>No sound but the wind, the creak of his saddle, the hoofbeats of his horse.<br><br>Seven days riding the ghost trails up out of Sonora, down from the Sierra Madre, through Apache country, keeping off the sky lines, and watching the beckoning fingers of the talking smoke.<br><br>Lean as a famine wolf but wide and thick in the shoulder, the man called Shalako was a brooding man, a wary man, a man who trusted to no fate, no predicted destiny, nor to any luck. He trusted to nothing but his weapons, his horse, and the caution with which he rode.<br><br>His hard-boned face was tanned to saddle leather under the beat-up, black, flat-crowned hat. He wore fringed shotgun chaps, a faded red shirt, a black handkerchief knotted about his throat, and a dozen scars of knife and bullet.<br><br>It was a baked and brutal land, this Sonora, sun-blistered and arid, yet as he sifted his way through the stands of organ-pipe cactus, prickly pear and cat's claw, he knew the desert throbbed with its own strange life, and he knew those slim fingers of lifting smoke beckoned death.<br><br>He was a lone-riding man in a lonesome country, riding toward a destiny of which he knew nothing, a man who for ten long years had known no other life than this, nor wished for any other.<br><br>What else there was he had known before, but now he lived from day to day, watching the lonely sunsets flame and die, bleeding their crimson shadows against the long, serrated ridges. Watching the dawns come, seeing the mornings stir with their first life . . . and the land he rode was a land where each living thing lived by the death of some other thing.<br><br>The desert was a school, a school where each day, each hour, a final examination was offered, where failure meant death and the buzzards landed to correct the papers.<br><br>For the desert holds no easy deaths . . . hard, bitter, and ugly are the desert deaths . . . and long drawn out.<br><br>Merciless were the raw-backed mountains, dreadfully desolate the canyons, the white-faced ancient lakes were dust . . . traps where a man might die, choking horribly upon alkali or the ashen powder of ancient rocks.<br><br>For seven days Shalako heard no sound but that of his own passage, and then a gunshot bought space in the silence, a harsh whiplash of sound, followed after an instant by the shattering volley of at least four rifles.<br><br>The rifles spoke again from the sounding board of the rocks, racketing away down the canyons to fade at the desert's rim.<br><br>Motionless upon a sun-baked slope, he waited while the sweat found thin furrows through the dust on his cheeks, but there was no further sound, no further shot, nor was there movement within the range of his vision . . . merely the lazy circle of a buzzard against the heat-blurred sky.<br><br>If they had not seen him already they would not see him if he remained still, and Shalako had learned his patience in a hard school.<br><br>Movement attracts the eye, draws the attention, renders visible. A motionless object that blends with the surroundings can long remain invisible even when close by, and Shalako was not moving.<br><br>About him lay vast, immeasurable distances, pastel shadings of salmon, pink, and lemon broken by the deeper reds of rock or the darkness of cliff shadow. Overhead the sun was lost in a copper sky above the heat-waved reaches where all sharpness of outline melted in the shimmering movement of the air.<br><br>The innocent distance that lay before him was broken by hollows, canyons, folded hills, but it seemed an even, unbroken expanse from where he sat. There were cholla forests out there, scatterings of lava . . . a land where anything might be and something obviously was.<br><br>The notch in the hills toward which he was pointing held a pass through the mountains, and within the pass lay a waterhole.<br><br>His canteen was half-full and if necessity demanded it could be made to last another three days . . . it had done so before. In the desert a man learns to use water sparingly and to make a little cover a lot of distance.<br><br>The roan gelding was a mountain-bred horse and could survive on cholla or prickly pear if the spines were burned away, but water and grass lay within that opening in the hills, and Shalako had no intention of skirting the mountain unless circumstances insisted. Yet the sound of shots had come from that direction.<br><br>After a while he made, with sparing movements, a cigarette, his eyes holding on the far, blue mountains briefly, then surveying the country while he worked with the small, essential movements. He considered the possibilities, knowing that a desert offers less freedom of movement than at first seems likely. All travel in the desert, of man or animal, is governed by the need for water. Some animals learned to survive for days without water, but man was not one of these.<br><br>Four rifles . . . at least four rifles had fired that volley, and four rifles are not fired simultaneously unless fired at another man or men.<br><br>Sunset was scarcely an hour away, and the waterhole was at least that far distant.<br><br>It was unlikely that whoever fired those shots would, at this hour, ride farther than the nearest water. Therefore the chances were that the water toward which he was riding would be occupied by whoever had done that shooting.<br><br>On the slope where he had drawn up neither the roan gelding nor himself would be visible at any distance, so he waited a little longer, inhaling deeply of the sharp, strong tobacco.<br><br>Four men do not fire in unison unless from ambush, and Shalako had no illusions about the sort of men who attack from concealment, nor what their attitude would be toward a drifting stranger who might have seen too much.<br><br>Whatever of gentleness lay within the man called Shalako was hidden behind the cold green eyes. There was no visible softness, no discernible shadow left by illusion. He was a man who looked upon life with a dispassionate, wry realism.<br><br>He knew he lived by care and by chance, knowing the next man he met might be the man who would kill him, or the next mile might see his horse down with a broken leg . . . and a man without a horse in this country was two-thirds a dead man.<br><br>To his thinking those men who thought their hour was predestined were fools. Whatever else nature was, it was impersonal, inexorable. He had seen too much of death to believe it was important, too much of life to believe that the destiny of any creature was important to any but itself or those dependent upon it.<br><br>There was always life. Humans and animals and plants were born and died, they lived their brief hour and went their way, their places filled so quickly they were scarcely missed.<br><br>Only the mountains lasted, and even they changed. Their lasting was only an idea in the minds of men because they lasted a little longer than men. Shalako knew he would live as long as he moved with care, considered the possibilities, and kept out of line of any stray bullet. Yet he was without illusions; for all his care, death could come and suddenly.<br><br>The margin for error was slight. A dry waterhole, a chance fall, a stray bullet . . . or an Apache he missed seeing first.<br><br>Those who talked of a bullet with their name on it were fools . . . to a bullet all targets were anonymous.<br><br>Behind him to the east lay Mexico, but what trail he left back there only an Apache or a wolf might follow. Deliberately, he had avoided all known waterholes, keeping to the roughest country, seeking out the rarely used seeps or tinajas, and avoiding the places an Apache might go in search of food.<br><br>He had seen nobody in those seven days, and nobody had seen him. He was quite sure of that for, had he been seen, he would be dead. Yet he knew that the Apaches had come down out of the Sierra Madre and were riding north.<br><br>He read the story in those weird hieroglyphics of the desert, the trails of unshod ponies, deserted rancherias, faint dust trails hanging above the desert, and always of course, the talking smoke.<br><br>Holding to the seeps and the natural tanks as he had, he had been fairly safe. Such places were rarely used except when the year was far along or it was a dry season. Early in the spring the desert waterholes were full and there was no need to stray from them.<br><br>Removing his hat, he wiped the sweatband. No further sounds had reached him, nor was there any dust. Around him the desert lay still as on the day the earth was born. Yet he did not move.<br><br>Big Hatchet Peak towered more than eight thousand feet just to the south and west. He had crossed the border from Mexico into the States at a point in the foothills of the Sierra Rica, knowing the approximate location of the waterhole toward which he was riding.<br><br>It lay about two miles up a canyon and two trails led from it. One started south and east, then swung westward toward Whitewater Wells, every inch of it Apache country.<br><br>The second trail was dim, scarcely used even by Indians, an ancient trail that dated back to the Mimbres people, long vanished from their old haunts, if not from the face of the earth.<br><br>This trail led almost due west from the waterhole, was much shorter and less likely to be watched. The mind of the man called Shalako, as of most Western men, was a storehouse of such information. Where guidebooks and maps are not available, every campfire, chuck wagon, and saloon bar becomes a clearinghouse for information.<br><br>It was hot, and the roan was streaked with sweat and dust. The border country can be cool in April. It can also be an oven, the way it was now.<br><br>He started his horse, walking it to keep the dust down. From the shade of a nearby boulder an irritable rattler buzzed unpleasantly, and then for a time a chaparral cock raced ahead of him, enjoying the company.<br><br>He paused again by a clump of ironwood, enjoying the fragrance from the yellow blossoms of some nearby cat's claw. Sometimes called "wait-a-minute," it was a low, spreading shrub with peculiar hooklike thorns that had crippled many a horse or other animal.<br><br>His eyes studied the desert. The tracks of a small lizard were visible in the sand . . . bees hummed around the cat's-claw blossoms. Shadows were beginning to thicken in some of the far-off canyons, although the sun was still high.<br><br>Shalako continued to walk his horse forward, and each time he mounted a slope, he came up easily at the crest until only his head showed above the hill, and there, holding very still to simulate a rock, he allowed only his eyes to move until he had scanned the area within view.<br><br>After almost an hour of slow progress, he rode down a draw toward a small playa, or dry lake. It was unlikely the killers had remained in the area but Shalako was not a trusting man.<br><br>Within the mouth of the draw he drew rein again. With his first glance he recognized the body for what it was, but only when he was quite sure that he was alone did he approach it. He circled it as warily as a wolf, studying it from all angles, and when finally he stopped within a dozen feet of the dead man he knew much of what had happened at this place.<br><br>The dead man had ridden a freshly shod horse into the playa from the north, and when shot he had tumbled from the saddle and the horse had galloped away. Several riders on unshod ponies had then approached the body and one had dismounted to collect the weapons.<br><br>The clothing had not been stripped off, nor was the body mutilated. Only when he could learn no more by observation did he dismount and turn the body over. He was already sure of the dead man's identity.<br><br>Pete Wells. . . .<br><br>An occasional scout for the Army, a sometime driver of freight wagons, a former buffalo hunter and lately a hanger-on around Fort Bowie, Fort Grant, or Tucson. A man of no particular quality, honest enough, and not a man likely to make enemies. Yet now he was dead, shot from ambush.<br><br>Circling, Shalako discovered where the ambushers had lain in wait.<br><br>Four men. . . . four Apaches.<br><br>He studied the droppings of the horses, kicking them apart with a boot toe. He recognized in those droppings seeds from a plant found in the foothills of the Sierra Madre, but not farther north.<br><br>These were not reservation Indians from San Carlos then, they were some of Chato's outfit, just up from below the border.<br><br>Their trail when they left Wells's body lay in the direction he himself was taking, and that meant the waterhole was off limits for Shalako unless he wished to fight them for it, and no man in his right mind started a fight with Apaches.<br><br>When the time came for fighting, the man Shalako fought with a cold fury that had an utterly impersonal quality about it. He fought to win, fought with deadly efficiency, with no nonsense about him, yet he did not fight needlessly.<br><br>Despite his weariness and that of his horse he began backtracking the dead man.<br><br>Pete Wells was not likely to be alone, so his presence indicated a camp nearby, and a camp meant water. Yet Shalako puzzled over his presence here at such a time.<br><br>The Hatchet Mountains were in a corner of New Mexico that projected somewhat south of the rest of the state line. It was a desert and mountain region, off the main trails and offering no inducements to travel except several routes into Mexico. These were routes used by the Apaches in making their raids, but by no one else.<br><br>Unless Wells had been with the Army.<br><br>Within a few minutes Shalako knew that was highly unlikely, for Wells had been following another rider or looking for someone whom he did not fear. Wells had mounted every ridge and knoll to survey the surrounding country, and Wells knew better than to take such risks.</p><h2>Napoleon (Penguin Lives)</h2><p>An acclaimed historian turns his sights on Napoleon, casting his towering life in a new light, from his early displays of military genius through his lust for power and his eventual defeat at Waterloo and exile on St. Helena. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Paul Johnson&#x2019;s many books, including <i>A History of Christianity, A History of the Jews, Modern Times, Churchill</i>, and <i>Napoleon: A Penguin Life</i>, have been hailed as masterpieces of historical analysis. He is a regular columnist for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, and his work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many others publications. He lives in London.Introduction<p>Few individuals have had more impact on history than Napoleon Bonaparte. He is the grandest possible refutation of those determinists who hold that events are governed by forces, classes, economics, and geography rather than by the powerful wills of men and women. Though Bonaparte exercised power only for a decade and a half, his impact on the future lasted until nearly the end of the twentieth century, almost two hundred years after his death. Indeed, his influence may not yet be spent. People love reading about him and his spectacular rise, just as in Roman and medieval times they read about Alexander. And they ponder the question: Might I, in comparable circumstances, have done as well? Few persons of ambition have failed to see Bonaparte as an exemplar or a spur. It is significant how many of those who exercise various forms of power, and wish for more-media tycoons, for example-have decked their offices or even their persons with Napoleonic memorabilia.</p><p>It is one of the contentions of this book that Bonaparte was not an ideologue but an opportunist who seized on the accident of the French Revolution to propel himself into supreme power. I say "accident" because the example of Britain and the Scandinavian countries showed that all the desirable reforms that the French radicals brought about by force and blood could have been achieved by peaceful means. As it was, the horrific course of the Revolution led, as was almost inevitable, to absolutism, of which Bonaparte was the beneficiary. And once installed in power he relentlessly sought further power by extending his rule to encompass most of Europe. It does not seem to have occurred to him to study the example of his older contemporary George Washington, who translated military victory into civil progress and renounced the rule of force in favor of the rule of law. But Bonaparte always put his trust in bayonets and cannon. In the end, force was the only language he understood, and in the end it pronounced a hostile judgment on him.</p><p>In the meantime, though, Bonaparte unleashed on Europe the most destructive wars the continent had ever experienced. For the first time, large-scale conscription played a notable part in swelling the armies, and their encounters became battles of entire nations. As the wars proceeded, the military casualties increased relentlessly, but the civilian populations also suffered in growing measure. First Italy, then Central Europe, finally Spain and Russia became victims of Bonaparte's wars of conquest. The German-speaking lands in particular were fought over again and again, and the eventual revulsion against Bonaparte played a critical part in creating a spirit of German nationalism that was to become aggressive and threatening itself. A new concept of total warfare was born, and alongside it grew other institutions: the secret police, large-scale professional espionage, government propaganda machines, and the faking of supposedly democratic movements, elections, and plebiscites. France herself, though fought over only in the final phases of the wars, suffered bitterly, and some of her losses were permanent. At a time when other European populations were growing fast, France's slowed down and began to stagnate, and in due course France inevitably began to slip from her position as the leading power in Europe to second-class status-that was Bonaparte's true legacy to the country he adopted.</p><p>The statesmen who gathered in Vienna after the military collapse of Bonapartist France were determined to restore not only the old legitimist thrones but, so far as they could, the old conventions and rules of law that had kept the peace, or limited the impact of hostilities when war broke out. The Congress of Vienna must be regarded as one of the most successful peace settlements in history. With some exceptions, it determined the frontiers of Europe for a century, and though it did not prevent all European wars, it made a general conflagration far less likely. The nineteenth century was, in general, a time of peace, progress, and prosperity in Europe, until the old system finally broke down in 1914-18.</p><p>Thereafter, however, the Bonapartist legacy, aided by France's decision to treat the dead ruler as a national hero and exemplar to the world, came into its own. The First World War itself was total warfare of the type Bonaparte's methods adumbrated, and in the political anarchy that emerged from it, a new brand of ideological dictator took Bonaparte's methods of government as a model, first in Russia, then in Italy, and finally in Germany, with many smaller countries following suit. The totalitarian state of the twentieth century was the ultimate progeny of the Napoleonic reality and myth. It is right, therefore, that we should study Bonaparte's spectacular career unromantically, skeptically, and searchingly. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, anxious as we are to avoid the tragic mistakes of the twentieth, we must learn from Bonaparte's life what to fear and what to avoid.</p><p></p><b>Chapter One<br>The Corsican Background</b><p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born on 15 August 1769 at Ajaccio on the island of Corsica. It is a paradox that this man who thought in terms of conquering entire continents should have had his life bounded by three islands: Corsica, less than half the size of Wales, no bigger than Vermont; Elba, much smaller, where a parody of his glory was enacted; and Saint Helena, a mere speck on the ocean, his death-prison. It was a vintage time to be born: 1769 was also the birth year of Bonaparte's nemesis, the duke of Wellington, and the politician who backed him, Viscount Castlereagh; and in and around this date were born many of the greatest spirits of the coming age: Chateaubriand and Madame de Sta&#x2018;l, two more of Bonaparte's dedicated enemies; Wordsworth and Coleridge, who cursed him in prose and verse; Beethoven, who dedicated his Eroica Symphony to the First Consul, then tore out the page in anger when he became emperor; and a host of others-Hegel and Schlegel, Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, George Canning, Metternich, and Sir Walter Scott.</p><p>It was a vintage year in other ways. The Industrial Revolution was just taking off in Britain, with textiles leading the way; and Captain Cook, landing at Botany Bay, brought the final continent, Australasia, into the West's compass. But Corsica was very remote from these and other great events. It was poor, wild, neglected, exploited, politically and economically insignificant. Exactly a hundred years later, the English artist Edward Lear descended on the island with his sketching materials and produced a scintillating visual record of its appearance, unchanged in a century: spiny, vertiginous mountains, almost impenetrable pine forests, vast fields of rocks and rare cataracts, and endless barren scrubland, known locally as le maquis, a word that was to become synonymous with guerrilla country. Its total income was tiny. The courts of Europe regarded it as almost worthless. The British took it twice in the eighteenth century, and twice relinquished it as more trouble than it was worth. It had belonged for hundreds of years to the Italian city-state of Genoa, which had acquired it in the age when Genoa was, next to Venice, the richest maritime power in the Mediterranean. But Genoese rule had never penetrated much inland from the sea towns, Bastia, Calvi, Bonifaccio, and Ajaccio. There was no profit in it. So local insurgents ruled the interior and occasionally struck at the walled coastal towns. In the 1760s, increasingly weak Genoa turned to the French for assistance, which the French provided. But they disagreed with Genoa's policy of allowing in the hated Jesuits, banned in France. They withdrew their forces, and in 1767 the insurgents took Ajaccio. For Genoa, this was the last straw, and in 1768 it sold the entire island to France by treaty, in return for a paltry sum. This was a critical event for Bonaparte for, born the next year, he automatically became a French citizen.</p><p>Not everyone despised Corsica. In his Du contrat social (1762), Jean-Jacques Rousseau remarked that, while government corruption was universal in Europe, one tiny country was still capable of legislating against it, in a spirit of primitive simplicity. That was Corsica, and he added that he had a presentiment that this island of nature would one day astonish Europe. In consequence, the sage was invited by the insurgents to come to Corsica and draw up a constitution, which would serve when they won their independence by the sword. He did not go. But he persuaded his young friend James Boswell, the future biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, to include the island in his grand tour, and arranged for him to see the leader of the insurgents, Pasquale Paoli, who bore the title of "General of the People." Boswell went, formed a lifelong admiration and friendship for Paoli, and left a vivid record of his journey, both in his diaries and in the book about Corsica he published on his return to Britain. The book made him famous-he was known as "Corsica Boswell"-and it was widely read in Europe. Among his readers was the young Bonaparte. It gave him ideas.</p><p>Not that Bonaparte ever had the ambition to become Corsica's liberator. That was Paoli's thankless role, and a small-time part at best. To people of Bonaparte's background, the future lay not inland but outward-on the high seas and the great landmasses beyond. People moved into and out of Corsica all the time. Among the ambitious of the coastal towns, there was no such thing as the timeless stability of the interior. The Bonapartes originally came from the minor nobility of sixteenth-century Tuscany. In Ajaccio they had become, as it were, hereditary lawyers, while retaining their titles of nobility, sixteen quarterings (ancestors with titles of nobility), and so forth. They operated on a small scale and were just rich enough to own their own house and garden and to employ servants. Carlo Mario da Buonaparte, as he called himself, married the fourteen-year-old Letizia, also of distant Italian noble extraction, but from a family that had heavily intermarried with the squireens of the wild interior. She gave him eight children who lived, of whom Napoleon, or Nabulion as he was registered, was the second. The name, eventually to give itself to an age, was of no significance. The father, from some notion of family piet�, simply repeated the name given by his great-grandfather to his second son. Bonaparte scarcely ever used it. An analysis of Napoleonic autographs, of which thousands exist, shows that he always signed himself Buonaparte, then later Bonaparte. This was the name by which all his friends, and even his first wife, Josephine, knew him and addressed him, both officially and familiarly, and it is the name I use throughout this book. When he became emperor, he reluctantly adopted Napoleon as his name, for reasons of royal protocol, and his second wife called him such. But he rarely signed the name Napoleon in full, simply scribbling "Nap" or "Np"; and sometimes he forgot his new rank and signed "Bonaparte."</p><p>Bonaparte has had more books written about him than any other individual, with the sole exception of Jesus Christ. They continue to appear at brief intervals, especially in English and French but also in many other languages, and they are read: publishers regard a Napoleon book as more likely to sell, by virtue of its subject alone, than any other biography. Nearly all these books speculate on the family or genetic origins of Bonaparte's soaring ambitions. Virtually all agree that the hardness in his nature came from his mother, not his father, an apparently ineffectual person who died young. Madame M�re was of sterner stuff. Some biographers therefore see his bellicosity as deriving from his wild Corsican forebears, with their cult of the iron law of revenge, the vendetta. Oddly enough, the one form of ferocity in which Bonaparte was a little deficient was revenge; he was uncharacteristically, if unpredictably, forgiving of injuries-not always or even usually, but often enough to surprise. Beyond reading Boswell's book and deriving from it lessons that had nothing to do with the island, he took no interest in the place once he had left it. He never visited it. It never figured in his geopolitical calculations. On the other hand, he gave no sign that he was ashamed of his origins. He simply dismissed it from the forefront of his mind as carrying no importance in the economy of his ambition.</p><p>The alternative theory of biographers is that Bonaparte was a throwback to the distant condottiero of his Tuscan ancestors, a soldier of fortune who would sell his sword to whoever would pay handsomely for it, and found a dynasty on the profits of war. It is true that, until France took over in 1768, Corsica looked to Italy, which was much nearer, and supplied its written language and culture. But Bonaparte never showed any affection for Italy as a country-he agreed with Metternich's definition of it: "a mere geographical expression"-and when he called his son and heir king of Rome, he was reincarnating a quite different and much earlier entity. He showed no sentiment toward any of its historic cities either, treating them like mere gold or silver coins to be snatched from enemies and awarded to members of his family or allies. The Italians themselves he despised.</p><p>Looking outward, to the sea, as a Corsican in Ajaccio would, he formed a boyhood admiration for the Royal Navy, which rode the Mediterranean waters, so far from home, so confidently. He expressed a desire to join the British navy as a midshipman cadet, and in due course to command one of those wonderfully polished, burnished, pipe-clayed, and smartly painted-and formidable-three-deckers that occasionally anchored in the harbor. But that required money, and even more "interest" (influence or pull), neither of which his family possessed. So the moment passed. But it is curious to reflect on this, his earliest ambition, and to wonder at how differently history would have evolved had his boyhood whim been satisfied. As a boy Bonaparte was distinguished by his gift for mathematics, which remained with him throughout his life and was of inestimable value in his profession. But it would have served him well at sea, too, and there can be no doubt he would have risen high in naval service and become a rival to Nelson. As it was, the sea, so inviting to ambitious Corsicans, became and remained his mortal enemy. He did not understand its true strategic significance, and the naval dimension of geopolitics always eluded him-his last, terminal mistake was to step aboard the HMS Bellerophon, on 15 July 1815, never to be a free man again. Bonaparte's bitterness against the British sprang partly from his belief that the power their supremacy at sea gave them was somehow unnatural, even unfair. It was his frustration at the unjust success of blockade that led him into the endless labyrinth of the Continental System, which proved a salient part of his undoing.</p><p>The only other occasion when Bonaparte offered his sword as a mercenary was when, already trained and commissioned as an officer in the French army, but angry at slow promotion, he considered serving the sultan of Turkey, as many European officers did at that time. But an opportunity to serve France in hig...</p></p><h2>The Apocalyptic Imagination: An Introduction to Jewish Apocalyptic Literature (The Biblical Resource Series)</h2><p>Apocalyptic literature evokes an imaginative world that is set in deliberate counterpoint to the experiential world of the present. Apocalypticism thrives especially in times of crisis, and it functions by offering a resolution of the relevant crisis, not in practical terms but in terms of imagination and faith.<br><br><i>The Apocalyptic Imagination</i> by John Collins is one of the most widely praised studies of Jewish apocalyptic literature ever written. And this second edition of Collins's study represents a complete updating and rewriting of the original work. Especially noteworthy is the chapter on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which now takes into account all of the recently published texts. Other chapters discuss apocalypse as a literary genre, explore the phenomenon and function of apocalypticism in the ancient world, study a wide range of individual apocalyptic texts, and examine the apocalyptic character of early Christianity.</p><p><b>John J. Collins </b>is Holmes Professor of Old Testament Criticism and Interpretation at Yale Divinity School. His many other books include <i>The Apocalyptic Imagination: An&nbsp;Introduction to&nbsp;Jewish Apocalyptic Literature, Early Judaism: A&nbsp;Comprehensive Overview,</i> and <i>The Oxford Handbook of Apocalyptic Literature.</i><br><b>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</b><br> "A very useful guide to the Jewish apocalypses and related literature... One will not find a better or more up-to-date survey of this material, which expresses a way of thinking that was so influential on formative Christianity, than in Collins's book."<br><br><b>The Bible Today</b><br> "This is a updated and rewritten edition of a highly acclaimed book that appeared in 1984. In it Collins expertly explains the apocalyptic genre and then examines the Enoch literature, Daniel, various oracles, testaments, and apocalypses, as well as the Qumran material. In the final chapter he addresses the presence of such thinking in early Christianity. Though this is primarily a study of literature, the various pieces are placed within their historical contexts in order to show how they are imaginative responses to events in history. Collins argues that apocalyptic material did not effect change in history, but offered a way to deal with it in a manner that is both courageous and faithful. The book provides important information about an important yet little known corpus of material. It is a valuable resource."</p><h2>In the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire</h2><p>The acclaimed author of Rubicon and other superb works of popular history now produces a thrillingly panoramic (and incredibly timely) account of the rise of Islam. &nbsp; No less significant than the collapse of the Roman Republic or the Persian invasion of Greece, the evolution of the Arab empire is one of the supreme narratives of ancient history, a story dazzlingly rich in drama, character, and achievement.&nbsp; Just like the Romans, the Arabs came from nowhere to carve out a stupefyingly vast dominion&#x20ac;&#x201d;except that they achieved their conquests not over the course of centuries as the Romans did but in a matter of decades. Just like the Greeks during the Persian wars, they overcame seemingly insuperable odds to emerge triumphant against the greatest empire of the day&#x20ac;&#x201d;not by standing on the defensive, however, but by hurling themselves against all who lay in their path.</p><p><p>Historian Tom Holland is the author of the works of history <i>Rubicon</i>, <i>Persian Fire</i>, and <i>The Forge of Christendom</i>.&nbsp; He reviews regularly for the <i>TLS</i>, and has adapted Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Virgil for BBC Radio. <i>Rubicon</i> was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize and won the 2004 Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History, and <i>Persian Fire</i> won the Anglo-Hellenic League&#x2019;s 2006 Runciman Award.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>@holland_tom<br>www.tom-holland.org<br>www.doubleday.com</p>1<br><br><i>Known Unknowns</i><br><i>Between Two Worlds<br></i><br>Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar, an Arab king celebrated for his long hair, his piety and his utter ruthlessness, had been brought to defeat. Leaving the reek of the battlefield, he rode his blood-flecked white charger down to the very edge of the Red Sea. Behind him, he knew, Christian outliers would already be advancing against his palace--to seize his treasury, to capture his queen. Certainly, his conquerors had no cause to show him mercy. Few were more notorious among the Christians than Yusuf. Two years previously, looking to secure the south-west of Arabia for his own faith, he had captured their regional stronghold of Najran. What had happened next was a matter of shock and horror to Christians far beyond the limits of Himyar, the kingdom on the Red Sea that Yusuf had ruled, on and off, for just under a decade. The local church, with the bishop and a great multitude of his followers locked inside, had been put to the torch. A group of virgins, hurrying to join them, had hurled themselves on to the flames, crying defiantly as they did so how sweet it was to breathe in "the scent of burning priests!"1 Another woman, "whose face no one had ever seen outside the door of her house and who had never walked during the day in the city,"2 had torn off her headscarf, the better to reproach the king. Yusuf, in his fury, had ordered her daughter and granddaughter killed before her, their blood poured down her throat, and then her own head to be sent flying.<br><br>Martyrdoms such as these, feted though they were by the Church, could not readily be forgiven. A great army, crossing from the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, had duly landed in Himyar. The defenders had been cornered, engaged and routed. Now, with the shallows of the Red Sea lapping at his horse's hooves, Yusuf had come to the end of the road. Not all his obedience to the laws granted to God's chosen prophet had been sufficient to save him from ruin. Slowly, he urged his horse forwards, breasting the water, until at last, weighed down by his armour, he disappeared beneath the waves. So perished Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar: the last Jewish king ever to rule in Arabia.<br>The collapse of the kingdom of the Himyarites in ad 525 is not, it is fair to say, one of the more celebrated episodes of ancient history. Himyar itself, despite having prospered for some six centuries until its final overthrow under Yusuf, lacks the ready brand recognition today of a Babylon, or an Athens, or a Rome. Unsurprisingly so, perhaps: for southern Arabia, then as now, was firmly peripheral to the major centres of civilisation. Even the Arabs themselves, whom the peoples of more settled lands tended to dismiss as notorious brutes--"of all the nations of the earth, the most despised and insignificant"3--might look askance at the presumed barbarities of the region. The Himyarites, so one Arab poet reported in shocked tones, left their women uncircumcised, "and do not think it disgusting to eat locusts."4 Behaviour that clearly branded them as beyond the pale.<br><br>Yet, it is not only in terms of its geography that Himyar seems to lie in shadow. Similarly obscure is the period in which the death of Yusuf occurred. The sixth century ad defies precise categorisation. It seems to stand between two ages. If it looks back to the world of classical civilisation, then so also does it look forward to the world of the Crusades. Historians categorise it, and the centuries either side of it, as "late antiquity": a phrase that conveys a sense of lengthening shadows, and the Middle Ages soon to come.<br><br>For anyone accustomed to thinking of history as a succession of neatly defined and self-enclosed epochs, there is something vaguely unsettling about this. Rather like the scientist in the classic horror film The Fly, who ends up a mutant combination of human and insect, the world of late antiquity can seem, from our own perspective, peculiarly hybrid. Far beyond the borders of Yusuf's Himyarite kingdom, empires raised on fabulously ancient foundations still dominated the Near East and the Mediterranean, as they had done for centuries. Yet, their very age served only to highlight how profoundly they were coming to slip the moorings of their past. Take, for instance, the region immediately to the north of Arabia: the land we know today as Iraq. Here, across mudflats that had witnessed the dawn of urban civilisation, loyalty was owed to a king who was, just as his predecessor had been a whole millennium previously, a Persian. His dominions, like those of the Persian Empire that had existed a thousand years before, stretched eastwards to the frontiers of India, and deep into Central Asia. The splendours of the court over which he presided, the magnificence of its rituals, and the immodesty of his pretensions: all would have been perfectly familiar to a king of Babylon. That this was so, however, had been almost forgotten by the people of Iraq themselves. A spreading amnesia was blotting out memories that had endured for millennia. Even the Persians, far from venerating the truth about their glorious imperial heritage, had begun to obscure and distort it. The legacy of Iraq's incomparable history lived on--preserved in the Persians' fantasies of global rule and in the many glories that lent such fantasies credence--but increasingly it wore the look, not of ages departed, but of something new.<br><br>Other superpowers were less neglectful of their pasts. The great cities of the Mediterranean, built of stone and marble rather than the mud-bricks favoured by the people of Iraq, were less prone to crumbling into dust. The empire that ruled them likewise wore, in 525, a veneer of venerable indestructibility. Even to the Persians, Roman might appeared something primordial. "God so arranged things," they would occasionally acknowledge, albeit through gritted teeth, "that the whole world was lit up from the beginning by two eyes: namely, by the wise rulers of the Persian realm, and by the powerful empire of the Romans."5 Nevertheless, the Romans themselves, although certainly never averse to flattery, knew better. Rather than believing that their empire had existed since the dawn of time, they knew perfectly well that all its greatness had evolved from nothing. To trace the course of that evolution might therefore be to fathom the secrets of its success. Even as Yusuf was vanishing into the Red Sea, plans were being laid in the Roman capital for an immense ransacking of libraries and archives, an unprecedented labour of scholarship whose goal was the preservation for all eternity of the empire's vast inheritance of laws. This was no arid, merely antiquarian project. History, no less than armies or gold, had come to function as one of the sinews of the Roman state. It offered the empire reassurance that it was precisely what it claimed to be: the model of human order. How, then, was the prestige of Caesar to be maintained, if not by a perpetual trumpeting of Rome's triumphant antiquity?<br><br>The challenge for Roman policy-makers, of course, was that the glories of the past did not necessarily provide them with a reliable guide for the future. Indisputably, the empire remained what it had been for almost a millennium: the most formidable superpower of all. Wealthier and more populous than its great Persian rival, its hold over the eastern Mediterranean, always the richer half, appeared secure. From the mountains of the Balkans to the deserts of Egypt, Caesar ruled them all. Nevertheless, it was clearly an embarrassment, to put it mildly, that what had once been the western half of Rome's empire had ceased, by 525, to be Roman at all. Over the course of the previous century, an immense swath of her holdings, like a sandcastle battered by the waves of an incoming tide, had crumbled utterly away. Britain had been lost as early as 410. Other provinces, over the succeeding decades, had followed. By the end of the century, the entire western half of the empire, even Italy, even Rome itself, had gone. In place of the venerable imperial order there was now a patchwork of independent kingdoms, all of them--with the exception of a few in western Britain--ruled by warrior elites from beyond the limits of the former empire. The relationship that existed between the natives and these "barbarian" newcomers varied from realm to realm: some, like the Britons, fought the invaders tooth and nail; others, like the Italians, were given to hailing them as though they were Caesars. Yet, in every case, the empire's collapse resulted in the forging of new identities, new values, new presumptions. These, over the long term, would lead to the establishment of a radically new political order in western Europe. Rome's abandoned provinces would never again acknowledge a single master.<br><br>Time would see both the great empires of the age--the Persian as well as the Roman--go the way of Nineveh and Tyre. Not so the states established in Rome's western provinces, some of which still commemorate in their modern names the intrusions back in late antiquity of barbarian war bands. Small wonder, then, that European historians have traditionally seen the arrival of the Franks in the land that would eventually become France, and of the Angles in the future England, as events of far greater long-term significance than the activities of any Caesar or Persian king. We know now, as their contemporaries did not, that ruin was stalking both the rival empires. A century on from the collapse of the Himyarite kingdom, and the two superpowers were staring into the abyss. That the Persian Empire would end up toppled completely while that of the Romans was left as little more than a mangled trunk, has traditionally served to mark them as dead-ends, bed-blockers, dinosaurs. How tempting it is to presume, then, that they must have perished of decrepitude and old age. The lateness of late antiquity, to those who trace in it only a calamitous arc of decline and fall, has the quality of dinner guests who refuse to get their coats once the party is over.<br><br>Except that the empires raised by the peoples of the age wer...</p><h2>Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman</h2><p>Winner of the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award, Clara Schumann has become a classic since its publication in 1985.

If you&#x2019;ll just send it to the papers and the websites and whatnot:</p><p><i>RICK REILLY, 56, sportswriter, died this week of one thing or the other. He probably had it coming.</i></p><p><i>Reilly published or posted over 2 million words in his 37-year career, most of them making fun of Barry Bonds and the size of his head.</i></p><p><i>At least Reilly tried to tell the truth in his stories and columns. He might not have always done it, but he tried. He also tried to make it all add up to something. He tried to make you laugh or cry or treat somebody better. Or worse. Once in awhile, he pulled it off.</i></p><p><i>Reilly was a very odd sportswriter in that he didn&#x2019;t really write about sports. He wrote more about people who played sports than the sports themselves. The high school stud quarterback who took the loneliest girl under his wing. The blind woman who travels by bus, train and sidewalk to every Yankees game. The sports-fan kid who was supposed to be 17 and looked 80.</i></p><p><i>Reilly covered every major sporting event except the Indy 500, and every minor one, including the world sauna championship, in which he placed 103rd. He saw over 100 countries, including some behind the Iron Curtain that no longer exist. He went to every state but North Dakota, although he&#x2019;s not really welcome in Nebraska, possibly because of this joke he told in Omaha:</i></p><p><i>Q: What do you call a hot tub full of Nebraska cheerleaders?</i></p><p><i>A: Gorillas in the mist.</i></p><p><i>He got decent at the piano for a while. Knew enough magic to annoy you. George Clooney made one of his movies. He had a TV series that lasted one episode. Had his own interview show that lasted 15. Helped raise over $50 million to fight malaria via Nothing But Nets, which he came up with because he was desperate for a column one week.</i></p><p><i>He saw the northern lights. He ran with the bulls. He saw the best people could be and the worst. He loved writing about big people acting small and small people acting big. He liked writing about the star of the team, but he preferred writing about the nobody at the end of the bench. He wrote short, medium and long, which was probably what he did best, but it&#x2019;s probably also why he&#x2019;s dead at 56. He always said every one of them takes a year off your life.</i></p><p><i>The son of an alcoholic, he made his own way. He could&#x2019;ve done better. He could&#x2019;ve done worse. His main deal was trying to write sentences nobody had ever read before, entertain people, and not have to get a real job. Also, to his undying credit, he never was on one of those everybody-yells sportswriter shows.</i></p><p><i>Oh, and he once took $5 off Arnold Palmer on the golf course.</i></p><p>When the speeches are done or the scotch is gone, whichever comes first, we&#x2019;ll drive up to the graveyard in monster trucks. It&#x2019;s going to be great. I&#x2019;ve arranged for junker cars to be parked along the way&#x2014;marked with a giant orange X&#x2014;and every truck gets to go over at least one of them. You&#x2019;re welcome.</p><p>At the grave site, there&#x2019;ll be an L.A. taco truck&#x2014;best eating known to man&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s <i>carta blanca</i>.

A few items I&#x2019;d like to see thrown in:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;My 7-Eleven smock. I worked there for a while before I got the writing gig. I have also been a grocery bagger, rental-shop clerk, lawn mower, book packer, parking hut attendant, flower deliverer, bank teller, gas jockey, and car washer. Got fired from most of them. I kept the smock to remind myself that writing is all I can do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;My 100-plus photo collection of people choking me, including Michael Phelps underwater. Made for funny pictures, except for the time Eli Manning didn&#x2019;t realize it was supposed to be a joke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;My laptop. I don&#x2019;t want anybody reading some of the columns I started and ditched. &#x201c;Why Ryan Leaf Is About to Turn This League on Its Ear.&#x201d; &#x201c;At 30, Phil Mickelson Is Done.&#x201d; &#x201c;25 Reasons I&#x2019;ll Never Tweet.&#x201d; Things like that. Plus, my wife has the kind of body that keeps whiplash specialists in business and I don&#x2019;t want anybody clicking on the &#x201c;My Pictures&#x201d; tab.<br><p>Speaking of my wife, it&#x2019;d be nice if she lost it at some point and dove on top of the casket as it&#x2019;s being lowered. But by then I figure she&#x2019;ll be too busy fending off advances from my single buddies. Or not fending them off. I can&#x2019;t blame either of them.</p><p>Then I&#x2019;d like to leave this note for my kids: &#x201c;Sorry I spent your inheritance. Love you. Hope you have as much fun as I did.&#x201d;</p><p>Lastly, I want the tombstone to say:</p><p>Here lies Rick Reilly</p><p>1958&#x2013;2014</p><p>Tried to write well</p><p>Anyway, that&#x2019;s it.

G. Kelley</strong></p><em>Reflections in Black</em>, the first comprehensive history of black photographers, is a groundbreaking pictorial collection of African American life. Featuring the work of undisputed masters such as James VanDerZee, Gordon Parks, and Carrie Mae Weems among dozens of others, this book is a refutation of the gross caricature of black life that many mainstream photographers have manifested by continually emphasizing poverty over family, despair over hope. Nearly 600 images offer rich, moving glimpses of everyday black life, from slavery to the Great Migration to contemporary suburban life, including rare antebellum daguerrotypes, photojournalism of the civil rights era, and multimedia portraits of middle-class families. A work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure our conception of American history itself, Reflections in Black demands to be included in every American family's library as an essential part of our heritage. A <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and <em>Washington Post Book World</em> Best Book of 2000, and a <em>Good Morning, America</em> best gift book of 2000. 600 duotone photographs, 32 pages of color.</p><p>A triumphant celebration of family, endurance, spirituality, and the diverse range of the black experience over the last two centuries, Reflections in Black overturns many common ideas about black life during the last century and a half, and through its sheer power and beauty rewrites American history itself.<p>Reflections in Black, the first comprehensive history of black photographers, is Deborah Willis's long-awaited, groundbreaking assemblage of photographs of African American life from 1840 to the present. Willis, a curator of photography at the Smithsonian Institution, has selected nearly 600 stunning photographs, with 487 in duotone and 81 in full color, of which more than 100 images have never before been seen. As this panoramic saga unfolds, we are given rich, hugely moving glimpses of African American life, from the last generation of slaves to the urban pioneers of the great migrations of the 1920s, from rare antebellum daguerreotypes of freemen to the courtly celebrants of the Harlem Renaissance, from civil rights martyrs to postmodern photographic artists of the 1990s.</p><p>Each photograph suggests an astonishing, often spellbinding story. Augustus Washington's mid-nineteenth-century portraits of African Americans, for example, offer a window of seeming calm in an American era known largely for its upheaval. A startling suite of J. P. Ball photographs depicts, in three images, the life, death, and burial of a black man hanged for murder in the territory of Montana. Equally arresting are the twentieth-century images: from James VanDerZee's glittering shot of a Harlem couple decked out in raccoon coats, to Ellie Lee Weems's photographs of everyday African Americans in 1930sAtlanta, to Addison Scurlock's gorgeous wedding photos, to A. P. Bedou's portrait of a rapt crowd listening to Booker T. Washington, to John W. Mosely's image of a young drum majorette marching in an Elks parade in 1940s Philadelphia, to Clarissa Sligh's fascinating peeks at African Americans submitting to the deceptively mundane chores of haircuts. These images reinforce the notion that there is no single black America, but a multitude of diversity and richness.</p><p>Also in Reflections in Black are great celebrity images, including classic photographs of Frederick Douglass, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Dinah Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Sarah Vaughn, Malcolm X, Muhammed Ali, James Coltrane, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and a veiled Coretta Scott King at her husband's funeral.</p><p>Reflections in Black is, finally and most powerfully, a refutation of the gross caricature of so many photographers who have, in their depiction of African Americans, continually emphasized poverty over family, despair over hope, rage over accomplishment. Exceptionally beautiful, monumentally important, Reflections in Black is not only that rare gift book that can be given on any occasion but also a work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure the imagination. It demands to be included in every American family's library as an essential part of our country's heritage.</p><strong>Deborah Willis</strong>, a MacArthur, Guggenheim, and Fletcher Fellow, is the author of <em>Reflections in Black</em>, <em>Posing Beauty</em>, <em>Michelle Obama: The First Lady in Photographs</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Obama: The Historic Campaign in Photographs</em>.

The volume has received wide coverage, fueled much passionate debate and caused not a little confusion. Alister McGrath, along with his wife Joanna, are ideal to evaluate Dawkins's ideas. Once an atheist himself, he gained a doctorate in molecular biophysics before going on to become a leading Christian theologian. He wonders how two people, who have reflected at length on substantially the same world, could possibly have come to such different conclusions about God. McGrath subjects Dawkins's critique of faith to rigorous scrutiny. His exhilarating, meticulously argued response deals with questions such as Is faith intellectual nonsense? Are science and religion locked in a battle to the death? Can the roots of Christianity be explained away scientifically? Is Christianity simply a force for evil? This book will be warmly received by those looking for a reliable assessment of <em>The God Delusion</em> and the many questions it raises--including, above all, the relevance of faith and the quest for meaning.</p><p>Alister McGrath (D.Phil., Oxford University) is president of the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics and senior research fellow, Harris Manchester College, Oxford. His numerous and wide-ranging historical and theological studies include Iustitia Dei: A History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification (2 vols., 1986), The Twilight of Atheism, Theology for Amateurs, "I Believe," Exploring the Apostles Creed, The Genesis of Doctrine: A Study in the Foundation of Doctrinal Criticism (1990), The Intellectual Origins of the European Reformation (1987) and Evangelicalism and the Future of Christianity (1995) and Scientific Theology (3 volumes, 2002-2003). <p>Joanna Collicutt McGrath studied experimental psychology at Oxford, then went on to specialize for some years in clinical neuropsychology, and subsequently studied Christian theology, particularly biblical studies. Currently she is lecturer in the psychology of religion at Heythrop College, University of London. She is also coauthor with Jeremy Duff of Meeting Jesus: Human Responses to a Yearning God.</p>"McGrath identifies Dawkins' flawed arguments with surgical precision. McGrath spotlights Dawkins' embarrassing biblical ignorance and exposes his religion-as-virus-of-the-mind theory as sociological naivete. This intelligent, yet accessible book is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject or for those with friends sucked under by the new current of atheist literature." (New Man, November/December 2007)<br><br>"The McGraths expeditiously plow into the flank of Dawkins's fundamentalist atheism, made famous in <em>The God Delusion,</em> and run him from the battlefield." (Publishers Weekly, May 14, 2007)<br><br>"Combining scholarship with a popular style, the McGraths examine Dawkins's arguments and find them wanting. They show the inadequacy of his argument on the major points, contending that Dawkins's critique of religion is based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence rather than on hard research and that he employs rhetoric rather than rationality." (Library Journal, August 2007)<br><br>"One could hardly think of a better apologist for theism than Alister McGrath. This atheist-turned-Christian, also of Oxford, is a professor of historical theology. But as a student of molecular biophysics, he possesses the dual credibility in science and religion that Dawkins lacks. Like watching one schoolboy do another's work, McGrath's true gift is pointing out what Dawkins is obliged to show in order to make his case." (Christianity Today, November 2007)<br><br>"Alister and Joanna McGrath offer a meaty book without all the gratuitous gristle, clearly making their points." (Jim Miller Review, June 2007)<br><br>"You cannot help but be impressed with the depth of scholarship which the McGraths bring to this discussion--something markedly different than Dawkins." (Deinde blog, deinde.org, August 18, 2007)<br><br>"You cannot argue with the McGraths' credentials or the content of this book. It is very well done." (Does God Exist? November/December 2007)<br><br>"Alister McGrath provides an excellent rebuttal to Dawkin's arguments against God and religion. Scholarly, yes but also very readable for lay people." (M. F. in Libraries Alive, February 2008)<br><br>"[T]he McGraths' book is an effective response." (Mark D. Barret, Esq., in Lay Witness, March/April 2008)<br><br>"While not exhaustive (by design), the McGraths have offered us a well-reasoned critique of the atheistic arguments of Dawkins, and left us with a cogent description of the inherent weaknesses in <em>The God Delusion.</em> I recommend it to my friends on both sides of this debate."

I spotted a parking space in front of our destination, a caf� where we dined frequently, sharing chowder, fried clams, gigantic iced teas, and dreams of the future.<br> I told my husband, Look, there&#x2019;s a parking space. Not only that there&#x2019;s money in the meter.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m glad,&#x201d; he murmured, seeking my eyes through his sunglasses. But I think my meter is running out.&#x201d; His metaphor fell on deaf ears. With a new life growing inside me our fourth child I may have been unwilling to accept his meaning.<br> At the time my husband&#x2019;s lapses in memory seemed innocuous. He might forget a neighbor&#x2019;s name or neglect to stop at the store or forget where the ignition was in the car, but I was clever at disregarding the hints of medical illness. After all, he frequently drove different cars as part of his advertising business, and he was so busy; keeping up with minor details was too much to expect. The situation will improve when we move into a new house, I told myself, or when the children are older, or when someone in the medical community will listen to what I am saying.<br> We moved, the children grew, and the improvement never happened. We were near financial ruin. Customers weren&#x2019;t calling us back; new jobs weren&#x2019;t coming our way. He had ever greater difficulty focusing and organizing his thoughts, sometimes rewriting ad copy he had finished the day before. Once so gentle, docile, and fun to be around, he became frustrated and angry. My mantra continued whenever I was awake: Things will be so much better when &#x201d; When?<br> Our journey into the world of dementia began in 1971, when no guideposts, advocates, manuals, or support groups were available to help us. The National Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association would not be organized for another decade. My husband was only in his forties, and I did not believe that his forgetfulness was a natural part of aging. The children chided their father occasionally about his absent-mindedness&#x201d; but seemed to see nothing deeper. The prescription for Valium to treat his supposed depression&#x201d; was refilled many times. And sometimes my husband unwittingly doubled the dose or forgot to take it at all.<br> Always well dressed in the past, my handsome, athletic husband began to need help matching his suit, tie, and shirt. I started to lay out his clothes for the next day before we went to bed at night. I made sure to tell him what fun I had selecting the outfits, but I was embarrassed to be doing this task. I never mentioned it to others.<br> Then in 1973, a major stroke paralyzed him on one side, and I replaced the Brooks Brothers suits with sweatsuits, which he soon stained with food. The stroke took away his language ability, transforming a man who had made his living through eloquent writing into someone who had to rely entirely on words of one syllable. Neurologists and physical therapists told me not to expect any improvements in his speech though he did learn to walk again, ever so slowly, with a leg brace and a walker. Life was very hard for all of us, but it was especially horrible for my husband. He became frustrated beyond comprehension.<br> At times he did not seem to recognize our children or me. Sometimes he appeared thoroughly perplexed about our home. I remember him angrily rattling the doorknob in an effort to go outside but not being able to open the door. And yet I also recall his having enough of his former self that when he looked at our young baby, tears would run down his face.<br> His abilities continued to decline. As soon as I became the least bit comfortable with his current condition, he would take another step in the downhill progression of dementia. I felt completely overwhelmed. At times I was diapering both our youngest child and my husband. There&#x2019;s no way I can do this, I would think to myself.<br> Finally things came to a head. My husband kept opening the door to go outside as if to escape from what was happening to him and my toddler would follow him out. Soon our son started trying to open the door and walk out on his own (this was before safety devices were so readily available). I realized I had to act proactively, positively, and immediately, before my husband and son left home and got lost. I installed a new handle higher on the door, leaving the old knob intact but disabled. My son could no longer rreach the door. More incredibly to me, my husband didn&#x2019;t understand the concept of the new handle: he would repeatedly go over to the door, try the olddddd knob, and think that the door was broken.<br> This tiny event made me realize that I could make some changes in the way we were living. I could stop walking on eggshells, in fear of what would happen next, and start making a positive difference in our surroundings and in my approach to his illness. I&#x2019;m a very competitive person, and I started thinking of the entire situation as a game a brand-new game I wanted to win. I knew I had to get suited up and be ready to play. Each daily task eating, dressing, toileting, everything was a new inning, a new round in this game.<br> I stopped making excuses for the changes in his behavior and the decline in his cognitive functions. The neurologist had told me that my husband&#x2019;s disease was progressive and would be fatal and in an odd way, that knowledge helped me. It gave me the energy I needed to cope with what he and I both faced, because I knew that the situation would not go on forever.<br> I vowed to learn to live with this person who was inhabiting the body of the man I cherished. I had to detach myself emotionally from the man my husband used to be and live now with the man he had become. The task at hand this minute, and every minute of every day was to ensure my family&#x2019;s survival; I couldn&#x2019;t waste time focusing on my lot in life. I had to deal with the reality of today.<br> I decided not to heed the hospital social workers who told me that my husband would be fine&#x201d; if he went to live at an institution for the mentally ill or at a nursing home for the elderly, where he would be with others suffering from dementia. In that era, I did not trust that hospital and nursing- home workers would try to connect with him. And I knew that if he stayed at home, I could still reach parts of this man. A great deal of the time, his emotions seemed akin to mine. If I can reach him on an emotional level, I thought, instead of on a verbal or cognitive one, maybe life can be less threatening and frustrating for him.<br> I started a two-part list of issues related to his illness. Those elements that I thought could be changed, ameliorated, or implemented I put in part one. The elements that no amount of concentrated effort could ever change I listed in part two. I wrote improved mobility&#x201d; on the first list, while I relegated return of speech&#x201d; to the second. I placed daily laughter&#x201d; on the list of goals that could be implemented and planting the garden&#x201d; on the list of those that could not. Eventually my lists filled a spiral-bound notebook, with several hundred entries.<br> After putting into practice the ideas and goals on the first list, I found that a smile from my husband, calmness in our household, meant a win for all of us. I wanted to laugh at the end of the day, not curl up in a corner or break down in despair.<br> From the items in my notebook I developed five simple tenets, which I now teach to people who care for patients with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease or related forms of progressive dementia such as vascular dementia, Pick&#x2019;s disease, and Lewybody disease. These ideas are the basis for the humanistic approach to caring that I call habilitation.&#x201d; The literal meaning of habilitate is to clothe or dress,&#x201d; but I use it in the sense of to make capable,&#x201d; which is actually an older meaning of the word. A habilitated person with dementia can live using his or her upper limits of function, intellect, emotion, and spirit. Using the tenets of habilitation, both patients and care partners can feel successful at what they do, rather than feeling constantly weighted down. (I prefer the terms care partner&#x201d; or habilitator&#x201d; to caregiver,&#x201d; which assumes less involvement on the part of the patient.) The following are the tenets that I developed, first for my own use at home and later for the use of other patients with dementias.<br><br>1. Make the Physical Environment Work. Simplify the environment. Accommodate perceptual loss by eliminating distractions.<br><br>2. Know That Communication Remains Possible. Remember that the emotion behind failing words is far more important than the words themselves and needs to be validated. Although many losses occur with this disease, assume that the patient can still register feelings that matter.<br><br>3. Focus Only on Remaining Skills. Value what abilities remain. Help the patient compensate for any lost abilities without bringing them to his or her attention.<br><br>4. Live in the Patient&#x2019;s World. Never question, chastise, or try to reason with the patient. Join her in her current place&#x201d; or time, wherever that may be, and find joy with her there.<br><br>5. Enrich the Patient&#x2019;s Life. Create moments for success; eliminate possible moments of failure, and praise frequently and with sincerity. Attempt to find humor wherever possible.<br><br> These tenets require continuous examination of how the patient thinks, feels, communicates, compensates, and responds to change, emotion, and love. Improving understanding in these areas can lead to the biggest successes in treatment.<br> Along with my direct experience, my decades of work with professional and family care partners have shown that the habilitation approach works. Having worked with thousands of patients and care partners over the years, I have come to know that even people with fatal neurological illnesses still possess the innate drive to maximize their potential. After observing the success of the habilitation approach, colleagues and friends began to study and implement the tenets themselves, easing the burden of care partners, developing activities for Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients, studying those in long-term care, and addressing their special architectural and interior design needs. All of these researchers from varying disciplines have long believed in and studied the innate drive that remains in people with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s. This shared belief has led to a clearer understanding of why we should continue to focus on patients&#x2019; positive aspects and remaining skills.<br> During the years I care partnered with my husband, I clarified the tenets, and both he and I were able to succeed at living under our changed circumstances. When he died in 1976, I moved back to my parents&#x2019; home with our four children, whose ages ranged from four to sixteen. I had told my parents that I wanted to stay with them just for a few weeks to figure out what I should do with the rest of my life; instead I stayed for fifteen years. The children grew up, and I bandaged cut fingers and injured spirits. They participated in Pop Warner football, Little League baseball, high school soccer, track, and championship swimming. They found friendship and love and went on to colleges and careers. Now that they are enriching the lives of others, I often wonder how they would have matured without the years of turmoil and distress, fear of the unknown, and terror of the known that they endured. Perhaps support and love for all of our family my husband included offset family tragedy.<br> After moving in with my parents, I immediately began working as a nursing assistant in a nursing home run by a local hospital. I soon became director of restorative services, which let me initiate a program to try to help several residents who had progressive dementias and who at that time bore such lofty diagnoses as organic&#x201d; and chronic&#x201d; brain syndrome. Before long, newly admitted people wanted to be included in the program, which was based on the habilitative tenets described above. I led daily sessions with the patients, worked with the care partners at the facility, and developed a support group for spouses. I have been leading such groups continually since 1978, and this work remains a great joy in my life.<br> The nursing home developed a special-care unit for the patients in the program, and soon we recognized that they were doing much better cognitively than they had done before and were participating more fully in daily living activities, such as dressing and bathing. All of the patients appeared calmer, which meant that their medications could be reduced. In this unit, restraints were removed; hugs were instituted.<br> After successfully mentoring the staff and performing daily cognitive and supportive interactions with a population that grew to comprise more than half of the patient roster at the facility, I attempted to have this new kind of care the habilitative approach recognized by state and national regulatory agencies concerned with confidentiality and the right to a private diagnosis. But in the 1970s, civil libertarians and others were loath to have specific beds set aside for patients with dementias. They were concerned that such groupings would reveal the patients&#x2019; diagnoses, which would be an invasion of privacy.<br> I was very lonely during that time. I had no one to talk to about changing the scene for cognitively impaired adults. Alzheimer&#x2019;s was beginning to be given as a diagnosis, even though it was treated as a brand- new discovery; but except for a few colleagues at the nursing home, no one was willing to listen to my ideas. I was so elated when I discovered John Panella at Cornell University, who was studying the impact of special programming on patients with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease at a day care facility in White Plains, New York. At last I had discovered someone else who believed that we could make a difference in the lives of Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients.<br> The establishment in 1980 of the National Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association gave me and the growing number of concerned individuals and organizations renewed courage to fight for specialized housing and programming. By 1981 the program at the nursing home where I worked became an officially sanctioned special unit. As attempts to duplicate it popped up all over the Northeast, I became happily busy teaching and mentoring.<br> During the next two decades, the National Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association grew, with branches in every state offering family support and patient care, professional education, research opportunities, and advocacy. And as other professionals became interested in the care of people with Alzheimer&#x2019;s, the effort to institute habilitative settings became easier. Advocates traveled to state houses and government agencies to describe the major differences that specialized care made in the lives of Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients, their families, and the staff of institutions caring for them. Special- care units now exist in every region of the United States, and specific programming for people with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and the related disorders are common in adult day health, assisted-living, and retirement centers.<br> Still, families need to be wary of institutions that claim to offer specialized care but do little more than secure the doors. Without trained staff, ongoing education, and a habilitative philosophy of care adopted by the whole staff, the unit is not special.&#x201d; Both the National Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association and its state chapters can help sort through the differences.<br> For people seekin...</p><h2>Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion (Radcliffe Biography Series)</h2><p>Robert Coles first met Dorothy Day over thirty-five years ago when, as a medical student, he worked in one of her Catholic Worker soup kitchens. He remained close to this inspiring and controversial woman until her death in 1980. His book, an intellectual and psychological portrait, confronts candidly the central puzzles of her life: the sophisticated Greenwich Village novelist and reporter who converted to Catholicism; the single mother who raised her child in a most unorthodox &#34;family&#34;; her struggles with sexuality, loneliness, and pride; her devout religious conservatism coupled with radical politics. This intense portrait is based on many years of conversation and correspondence, as well as tape-recorded interviews.</p><p><b>Robert Coles</b> is an American author, child psychiatrist, and professor emeritus at Harvard University.Pulitzer Prize-winning Coles ( Children of Crisis ) here presents Dorothy Day, founder of the newspaper the Catholic Worker , whom he acknowledges as spiritual mentor.

Moreover, most of the relevant primary documents have existed only in Chinese, scattered in hard-to-find publications. <i>Contemporary Chinese Art</i> remedies this situation by bringing together carefully selected primary texts in English translation. Arranged in chronological order, the texts guide readers through the development of avant-garde Chinese art from 1976 until 2006. Because experimental Chinese art emerged as a domestic phenomenon in the 1970s and 1980s and its subsequent development has been closely related to China&#x2019;s social and economical transformation, this volume focuses on art from mainland China. At the same time, it encompasses the activities of mainland artists residing overseas, since artists who emigrated in the 1980s and 1990s were often key participants in the early avant-garde movements and have continued to interact with the mainland art world. The primary documents include the manifestos of avant-garde groups, prefaces to important exhibitions, writings by representative artists, important critical and analytical essays, and even some official documents. Each chapter and section begins with a concise preface explaining the significance of the texts and providing the necessary historical background; the volume includes a timeline summarizing important art phenomena and related political events.<p></p><p>Publication of the Museum of Modern Art</p></p><p>"Chinese contemporary art is the darling of the international art market today, but two decades ago who would have imagined this sudden phenomenon? And, what were the participants thinking? This indispensable reader shows us through selected writings from 1979 to 2000 by many of those who made it happen: the artists, the critics and theorists, the curators, the art historians. Even the table of contents imposes a sense of order on this complex art movement, and what follows will enlighten anyone who studies, buys, or simply looks at the Chinese art of our time."--Jerome Silbergeld, P.Y. &amp; Kinmay W.

Torrance's <em>Incarnation: The Person and Life of Christ</em> presents the material on the work of Christ, centered in the atonement, given originally in his lectures delivered to his students in Christian Dogmatics on Christology at New college, Edinburgh, from 1952-1978. Like the first volume, the original lecture material has been expertly edited by Robert Walker, complete with cross-reference to Torrance's other works. Readers will find this the most readable work of Torrance and, together with <em>Incarnation</em>, the closest to a systematic theology we have from this eminent theologian.</p><p>Thomas F. Torrance (1913&#x2014;2007) occupied the chair of Christian dogmatics at the University of Edinburgh for twenty-seven years. He was the recipient of the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in 1978, and he served as moderator of the Church of Scotland and coeditor of the <em>Scottish Journal of Theology.</em> He wrote extensively, contributing more than twenty major works of theology and hundreds of articles in a variety of languages."This is a towering work that deserves to be read throughout the ecumenical churches, to whose renewal and imperative reunion it promises to make a vital contribution." (George Hunsinger, Hazel Thompson McCord Professor of Systematic Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Nowhere else in T. F. Torrance's writings will you find the kind of synthesis of the entire sweep of his dogmatics as you will find in <em>Incarnation</em> and its companion volume, <em>Atonement.</em> Everyone concerned with constructive systematic theology in general, or with Torrance's theology in particular, will want to acquire and read these books. They reveal the heart and soul of Torrance's theological vision." (Elmer Colyer, Professor of Historical Theology, University of Dubuque)<br><br>"The posthumous publication of T. F. Torrance's New College lectures on soteriology is indeed an event. What is intended here is an account of the saving work of Christ which does justice to the full sweep of biblical testimony (Old Testament as well as New). What is achieved is something on the order of a model of models--an appropriation of the values resident in traditional ontological, forensic and moral models in an original synthesis that commands attention and respect. Torrance's stature as the leading Scottish theologian of the twentieth century will only be enhanced by these lectures, ably edited by Robert Walker." (Bruce McCormack, Charles Hodge Professor of Systematic Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Good theologians can write learned books on the atonement. But it is a particular gift to write a learned book on the atonement that is also clear, accessible and passionate. T. F. Torrance's <em>Atonement</em> has these qualities and more. The book is deeply rooted in Scripture and in Christian tradition, and it consistently points the way to Christian living and ministry. This is a book that will be formative for seminary students and pastors, as well as all who seek to understand more richly the core of the faith." (Leanne Van Dyk, dean and vice president for academic affairs, and professor of Reformed theology, Western Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In this indispensable volume of rare insight and erudition, Thomas F. Torrance demonstrates once again why he is esteemed as one of the leading theologians of the twentieth century. Weaving together Old and New Testament conceptions, Torrance here lucidly, profoundly, thoroughly and compellingly explains how and why Christ's atoning death can be understood only soteriologically (not logically) on the ground of the incarnation, resurrection and ascension of Jesus himself. Throughout this book, Torrance powerfully conveys the meaning and significance of the deep mystery of Christ's death on the cross as an act of God, fulfilling the covenant both from the side of God for us and from the human side toward God in the person of his incarnate Son, Jesus Christ, by carefully connecting Christ's own self-understanding and activity with the activity of the Spirit sent by the Father and Son to guide the church in Word and sacrament until he returns. All who are interested in serious theology today should read this book." (Paul Molnar, professor of systematic theology, St. John's University, New York)<br><br>"An invaluable resource for students of Torrance, and a highly stimulating resource for all interested in Christian theology. It will be hard to come away from this book without a feeling of having been enriched and challenged." (Alister E. McGrath, professor of theology, ministry and education, and head of the Centre for Theology, Religion and Culture, King's College, London)<br><br>"Continuing the exploration of the mystery of the Son of God begun in <em>Incarnation,</em> Torrance turns his attention in this second volume to the work of the incarnate Savior, with the purposiveness, analytical penetration and spiritual lucidity which mark him out as one of the most weighty dogmaticians of the modern Reformed tradition." (John Webster, professor of systematic theology, University of Aberdeen)<br><br>"A worthy sequel to Torrance's magisterial lectures on the incarnation, this book takes us through a series of major themes in Christian theology with immense authority and clarity. Detailed exegetical study of the biblical meanings of substitution, clear teaching on the centrality of the resurrection and the church in a theology of redemption, and fresh thinking about the relation of divine and human agency in the writing of Scripture--these are just some of the treasures to be found here."

Now, twenty years later, comes the sequel - a story of passion, and victory pulled from defeat. <p>After his young athlete lover is assassinated on the Olympic track in Montreal, coach Harlan Brown is forced to enter the race of his life. To survive the hate and violence which threaten his chosen family - Betsy, valiant lesbian mother, Vince, angry activist seeking revenge, Chino, Vietnam vet with a wounded heart, and the secret child of Billy Sive, The Front Runner. </p><p>In time, a second chance at love comes. Vince Matti, 25, a runner who was Billy's best friend, has harbored an unrequited passion for his ex-Marine coach. Handsome, volatile, and passionate, Vince challenges Harlan's stoic and lonely heart in unimagined ways. Harlan must race with the shadow of the past - that memory of the brief idyll with Billy - and reach a present where love is enduring and real. </p><p>Meanwhile, Harlan's ordeal with bias and bloodshed is not over. Snipers often work in pairs, and the Montreal shooter evidently had a cohort who escaped arrest. This mysterious stalker moves implacably into Harlan's world. And yet another stalker is moving into gay life - a disease that has no name. As events move to the climax, Harlan runs the most desperate race of his life - risking everything to win the victory torn from his hands at Montreal.</p></p><p>Patricia Nell Warren is the landmark author of some of the most popular gay novels of all time.

As the daughter of a prominent British physician and a Brahmin woman of the highest caste, she had known only luxury. Trained by her father in the medical arts since she was old enough to read, she graduated from the University of Delhi as a Doctor of Medicine by the age of twenty-two. Welcomed into her father&#x2019;s lucrative practice, she treated many of the wives and daughters of the British military personnel who made up a large percentage of their patients in the colonial India of 1909. <p> But the science of medicine was not Maya&#x2019;s only heritage. For Maya&#x2019;s aristocratic mother Surya, had not just defied her family, friends and religion to marry Maya&#x2019;s father, she had turned her back on her family&#x2019;s powerful magical traditions as well. For her mother was a sorceress&#x2014;a former priestess of the mystical magics fueled by the powerful and fearsome pantheon of Indian gods.</p><p> Though Maya felt the stirring of magic in her blood, her mother had repeatedly refused to train her. &#x201c;<i>I cannot</i>,&#x201d; she had said, her eyes dark with distress, whenever Maya asked. &#x201c;<i>Yours is the magic of your father&#x2019;s blood, not mine</i>....&#x201d; Surya had never had the chance to explain this enigmatic statement to her daughter, before cholera claimed her life. Yet Maya suspected that something far more sinister than the virulent disease had overcome her powerful mother.</p><p> But it was Maya&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s death shortly thereafter which confirmed her darkest suspicions. For her father was killed by the bite of a krait, a tiny venomous snake, and in the last hours of her mother&#x2019;s life, in the seeming delirium of her fever, Surya had repeatedly warned Maya to beware &#x201c;the serpent&#x2019;s shadow.&#x201d; With the sudden loss of her father, Maya knew she must flee the land of her birth or face the same fate as her parents. </p><p>In self-imposed exile in London, Maya surrounded herself with every protection possible. All the magic Maya knew had been learned by covertly observing her mother, and by cobbling this knowledge together with the street-magic gleaned from a few genuine fakirs. Her workings were a mixture of instinct, extrapolation, and trial-and-error. Crude, but somewhat effective, her spells let Maya hide her household behind a wall of secrecy in a poorer section of the city. Here, in a small but adequate house she lived with only the most loyal of her mother&#x2019;s servants, and her mother&#x2019;s seven unusual &#x201c;pets&#x201d;&#x2014;if you could use such a word for creatures who seemed far more like friends. For Charan, the little monkey, Rajah, the peacock, Mala, the falcon, Sia and Singhe, the mongooses, Rhadi, the parrot, and Nisha, the owl seemed far too sentient to be ordinary animals. Maya knew that these seven unusual and loving companions had been in some way special to her mother, but their secrets were hidden to her, perhaps forever.</p><p> In her new home she fought the dual prejudices against her sex and her race to continue in her medical profession. Only her high scholastic abilities and her extreme determination enabled her to meet with any success. She managed to place herself in a minor position at a prestigious hospital while she pursued her own medical passions: helping the poor at a tiny clinic where they welcomed any doctor, and setting up a small, controversial practice which specialized in &#x201c;female complaints&#x201d; and offered &#x201c;absolute discretion.&#x201d;</p><p> But Maya knew that she could not hide forever from the vindictive power which had murdered her parents. She knew in her heart that even a vast ocean couldn&#x2019;t protect her from &#x201c;the serpent&#x2019;s shadow&#x201d; which had so terrified her mother. Her only hope was to find a way to master her own magic: the magic of her father&#x2019;s blood. But who...</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Mercedes Lackey returns to form in <i>The Serpent's Shadow</i>, the fourth in her sequence of reimagined fairy tales. This story takes place in the London of 1909, and is based on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." Lackey creates echoes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pays affectionate homage to Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey (who plays an important role under a thin disguise), and turns the dwarves into seven animal avatars who masquerade as pets of her Eurasian heroine, Maya.<p> Some of Maya's challenges come from the fact that she is <i>not</i> "snow white," and she has fled India for her father's English homeland after the suspicious deaths of her parents. Establishing her household in London, she returns to her profession as a physician, working among the poor. Her "pets" and loyal servants stand guard, and Maya herself uses what bits of magic she managed to pick up in childhood to weave otherworldly defenses as well. But the implacable enemy who killed her parents has come to London to search for her; if Maya can be enslaved, her enormous potential powers can be used to the enemy's ends. Fortunately, English magicians of the White Lodge have also noted a new, powerful presence in their midst, though they're having trouble locating her, too. They send Peter Scott, a Water Master, to track her down. He finds Maya beautiful and benign, and is determined to teach her to use the Western magic she is heir to, before her enemy discovers her. </p><p> Some will find the author's Kiplingesque descriptions of India and Hindustani culture offensive. Lackey describes Maya's enemy as a powerful devotee of the goddess Kali-Durga, though she carefully shows that the avatars of the other deities will not attack her, and has Kali-Durga repudiate her servant in the climactic confrontation. And, though the story is layered, its surface is as glossy and brightly colored as an action comic. But readers who enjoy late Victorian London, Sayers, Sherlock Holmes stories, and a page-turning tale will want to take this one home. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is a full-time writer and has published numerous novels and works of short fiction, including the best-selling <b>Heralds Of Valdemar</b> series.

It is cold, mist rising from the forest floor, sheathing the green bamboo trees in the grove, muffling sounds, hiding the Twelve Peaks to the east. The maple leaves on the way here are red and yellow on the ground, and falling. The temple bells from the edge of town seem distant when they ring, as if from another world.</p><p>There are tigers in the forests here, but they hunt at night, will not be hungry now, and this is a small grove. The villagers of Shengdu, though they fear them and the older ones make offerings to a tiger god at altars, still go into the woods by day when they need to, for firewood or to hunt, unless a man&#x2013;eater is known to be about. At such times a primitive terror claims them all, and fields will go untilled, tea plants unharvested, until the beast is killed, which can take a great effort, and sometimes there are deaths.</p><p>The boy was alone in the bamboo grove on a morning swaddled in fog, a wan, weak hint of sun pushing between leaves: light trying to declare itself, not quite there. He was swinging a bamboo sword he&#x2019;d made, and he was angry.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been unhappy and aggrieved for two weeks now, having reasons entirely sufficient in his own mind, such as his life lying in ruins like a city sacked by barbarians.</p><p>At the moment, however, because he was inclined towards thinking in certain ways, he was attempting to decide whether anger made him better or worse with the bamboo sword. And would it be different with his bow?</p><p>The exercise he pursued here, one he&#x2019;d invented for himself, was a test, training, discipline, not a child&#x2019;s diversion (he wasn&#x2019;t a child any more).</p><p>As best he could tell, no one knew he came to this grove. His brother certainly didn&#x2019;t, or he&#x2019;d have followed to mock&#x2014;and probably break the bamboo swords.</p><p>The challenge he&#x2019;d set himself involved spinning and wheeling at speed, swinging the too&#x2013;long (and also too&#x2013;light) bamboo weapon as hard as he could, downstrokes and thrusts&#x2014;without touching any of the trees surrounding him in the mist.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been doing this here for two years now, wearing out&#x2014;or breaking&#x2014;an uncountable number of wooden swords. They lay scattered around him. He left them on the uneven ground to increase the challenge. Terrain for any real combat would have such obstacles.</p><p>The boy was big for his age, possibly too confident, and grimly, unshakably determined to be one of the great men of his day, restoring glory with his virtue to a diminished world.</p><p>He was also the second son of a records clerk in the sub&#x2013;prefecture town of Shengdu, at the western margin of the Kitan empire in its Twelfth Dynasty&#x2014;which pretty much eliminated the possibility of such ambition coming to fulfillment in the world as they knew it.</p><p>To this truth was now added the blunt, significant fact that the only teacher in their sub&#x2013;prefecture had closed his private school, the Yingtan Mountain Academy, and left two weeks ago. He had set off east (there was nowhere to go, west) to find what might be his fortune, or at least a way to feed himself.</p><p>He&#x2019;d told a handful of his pupils that he might become a ritual master, using arcane rites of the Sacred Path to deal with ghosts and spirits. He&#x2019;d said that there were doctrines for this, that it was even a suggested life for those who&#x2019;d taken the examinations but not achieved jinshi status. Teacher Tuan had looked defensive, bitter, telling them this. He&#x2019;d been drinking steadily those last weeks.</p><p>The boy hadn&#x2019;t known what to make of any of that. He knew there were ghosts and spirits, of course, hadn&#x2019;t realized his teacher knew anything about them. He wasn&#x2019;t sure if Tuan Lung really did, if he&#x2019;d been joking with them, or just angry.</p><p>What he did know was that there was no way to pursue his own education any more, and without lessons and a good teacher (and a great deal more) you could never qualify for the prefecture civil service tests, let alone pass them. And without passing those first tests the never&#x2013;spoken ambition of going to the capital for the jinshi examinations wasn&#x2019;t even worth a dreaming night.</p><p>As for these exercises in the wood, his fierce, bright dream of military prowess, of regaining honor and glory for Kitai . . . well, dreams were what happened when you slept. There was no path he could see that would now lead him to learning how to fight, lead men, live or even die for the glory of Kitai.</p><p>It was a bad time all around. There had been a tail&#x2013;star in the spring sky and a summer drought had followed in the north. News came slowly to Szechen province, up the Great River or down through the mountains. A drought, added to war in the northwest, made for a hard year.</p><p>It had remained dry down here all winter. Usually Szechen was notorious for rain. In summertime the land steamed in the humidity, the leaves dripped rainwater endlessly, clothing and bedding never dried. The rain would ease in autumn and winter, but didn&#x2019;t ever cease&#x2014;in a normal year.</p><p>This hadn&#x2019;t been such a year. The spring tea harvest had been dismal, desperate, and the fields for rice and vegetables were far too dry. This autumn&#x2019;s crops had been frighteningly sparse. There hadn&#x2019;t been any tax relief, either. The emperor needed money, there was a war. Teacher Tuan had had things to say about that, too, sometimes reckless things.</p><p>Teacher Tuan had always urged them to learn the record of history, but not be enslaved by it. He said that histories were written by those with motives for offering their account of events.</p><p>He&#x2019;d told them that Xinan, the capital of glorious dynasties, had held two million people once, and that only a hundred thousand or so lived there now, scattered among rubble. He&#x2019;d said that Tagur, to the west of them here, across the passes, had been a rival empire long ago, fierce and dangerous, with magnificent horses, and that it was now only a cluster of scrabbling provinces and fortified religious retreats.</p><p>After school was done some days, sitting with his older students, he&#x2019;d drink wine they poured respectfully for him and sing. He&#x2019;d sing, &#x201c;Kingdoms have come, kingdoms have gone / Kitai endures forever . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The boy had asked his father about these matters once or twice, but his father was a cautious, thoughtful man and kept his counsel.</p><p>People were going to starve this coming winter, with nothing from the tea harvest to trade at the government offices for salt, rice, or grain from downriver. The state was supposed to keep granaries full, dole out measures in times of hardship, sometimes forgive taxes owed, but it was never enough, or done soon enough&#x2014;not when the crops failed.</p><p>So this autumn there were no strings of cash, or illicit tea leaves kept back from the government monopoly to sell in the mountain passes to pay for a son&#x2019;s education, however clever and quick he was, however his father valued learning.</p><p>Reading skills and the brush strokes of calligraphy, poetry, memorizing the classics of the Cho Master and his disciples . . . however virtuous such things were, they did tend to be abandoned when starvation became a concern.</p><p>And this, in turn, meant no chance of a life for the scholar&#x2013;teacher who had actually qualified for the examinations in the capital. Tuan Lung had taken the jinshi examinations twice in Hanjin, before giving up and coming home to the west (two or three months&#x2019; journey, however you travelled) to found his own academy for boys looking to become clerks, with perhaps a legitimate jinshi candidate among the really exceptional.</p><p>With an academy here it was at least possible that someone might try the provincial test and perhaps, if he passed, the same imperial examination Lung had taken&#x2014;perhaps even to succeed there and &#x201c;enter the current,&#x201d; joining the great world of court and office&#x2014;which he hadn&#x2019;t done, since he was back here in Szechen, wasn&#x2019;t he?</p><p>Or had been, until two weeks ago.</p><p>That abrupt departure was the source of the boy&#x2019;s anger and despair, from the day he bade his teacher farewell, watching him ride away from Shengdu on a black donkey with white feet, taking the dusty road towards the world.</p><p>The boy&#x2019;s name was Ren Daiyan. He&#x2019;d been called Little Dai most of his life, was trying to make people stop using that name. His brother refused, laughing. Older brothers were like that, such was Daiyan&#x2019;s understanding of things.</p><p>It had begun raining this week, much too late, though if it continued there might be some faint promise for spring, for those who survived the winter that was coming.</p><p>Girl&#x2013;children were being drowned at birth in the countryside, they&#x2019;d learned in whispers. It was called bathing the infant. It was illegal (hadn&#x2019;t always been, Teacher Tuan had told them), but it happened, was one of the surest signs of what was in store.</p><p>Daiyan&#x2019;s father had told him that you knew it was truly bad when boys were also put into the river at birth. And at the very worst, he&#x2019;d said, in times when there was no other food at all . . . he&#x2019;d gestured with his hands, not finishing the thought.</p><p>Daiyan believed he knew what his father meant, but didn&#x2019;t ask. He didn&#x2019;t like thinking about it.</p><p>In fog and ground&#x2013;mist, the early&#x2013;morning air cool and damp, the breeze from the east, the boy slashed, spun, thrust in a bamboo wood. He imagined his brother receiving his blows, then barbarian Kislik with their shaved scalps and long, unbound fringe hair, in the war to the north.</p><p>His judgment as to the matter of what anger did to his blade skills, made before, confirmed this morning, was that it made him faster but less precise.</p><p>There were gains and losses in most things. Speed against control represented a difference to be adjusted for. It would be different with his bow, he decided. Precision was imperative there, though speed would also matter for an archer facing many foes. He was exceptionally good with a bow, though the sword had been by far the more honored weapon in Kitai in the days (gone now) when fighting skills were respected. Barbarians like the Kislik or Xiaolu killed from horseback with arrows, then raced away like the cowards they were.</p><p>His brother didn&#x2019;t know he had a bow or he&#x2019;d have claimed it for himself as Eldest Son. He would then, almost certainly, have broken it, or let it be ruined by dampness, since bows needed caring for, and Ren Tzu wasn&#x2019;t the caring&#x2013;for sort.</p><p>It had been his teacher who had given the bow to Daiyan.</p><p>Tuan Lung had presented it to him one summer afternoon a little more than a year ago, alone, after classes were done for the day, unwrapping it from an undyed hemp cloth.</p><p>He&#x2019;d also handed Daiyan a book that explained how to string it properly, care for it, make arrow shafts and heads. It marked a change in the world, in their Twelfth Dynasty, having books here. Teacher Tuan had said that many times: with block printing, even a sub&#x2013;prefecture as remote as theirs could have information, printed poems, the works of the Master, if one could read.</p><p>It was what made a school such as his own possible.</p><p>It had been a private gift: the bow, a dozen iron arrowheads, the book. Daiyan knew enough to hide the bow, and then the arrows he began to make after reading the book. In the world of the Twelfth Dynasty, no honorable family would let a son become a soldier. He knew it; he knew it every moment he drew breath.</p><p>The very thought would bring shame. The Kitan army was made up of peasant farmers who had no choice. Three men in a farming household? One went to the army. There might be a million soldiers, even more (since the empire was at war again), but ever since savage lessons learned more than three hundred years ago it was understood (clearly understood) that the court controlled the army, and a family&#x2019;s rise to any kind of status emerged only through the jinshi examinations and the civil service. To join the army, to even think (or dream) of being a fighting man, if you had any sort of family pride, was to disgrace your ancestors.</p><p>That was, and had been for some time, the way of things in Kitai.</p><p>A military rebellion that had led to forty million dead, the destruction of their most glittering dynasty, the loss of large and lucrative parts of the empire . . . That could cause a shift in viewpoint.</p><p>Xinan, once the dazzling glory of the world, was a sad and diminished ruin. Teacher Tuan had told them about broken walls, broken&#x2013;up streets, blocked and evil&#x2013;smelling canals, fire&#x2013;gutted houses, mansions never rebuilt, overgrown gardens and market squares, parks with weeds and wolves.</p><p>The imperial tombs near the city had been looted long ago.</p><p>Tuan Lung had been there. One visit was enough, he&#x2019;d told them. There were angry ghosts in Xinan, the charred evidence of old burning, rubble and rubbish, animals in the streets. People living huddled in a city that had held the shining court of all the world.</p><p>So much of their own dynasty&#x2019;s nature, Teacher Tuan told them, flowed like a river from that rebellion long ago. Some moments could define not only their own age but what followed. The Silk Roads through the deserts were lost, cut off by barbarians.</p><p>No western treasures flowed to Kitai now, to the trading cities or the court in Hanjin. No legendary green&#x2013;eyed, yellow&#x2013;haired dancing girls bringing seductive music. No jade and ivory or exotic fruits, no wealth of silver coins brought by merchants to buy longed&#x2013;for Kitan silk and carry it back west on camels through the sands.</p><p>This Twelfth Dynasty of Kitai under their radiant and glorious emperor did not rule and define the known world. Not any more.</p><p>Tuan Lung had taught this to that same handful of them (never in class). In Hanjin, at the court, they still claimed to do so, he said, and examination questions expected answers that said as much. How does a wise minister use barbarians to control barbarians?</p><p>Even when they carried wars to the Kislik, they never seemed to win them. Recruited farmers made for a large army but not a trained one, and there were never enough horses.</p><p>And if the twice&#x2013;yearly tribute paid to the much more dangerous Xiaolu in the north was declared to be a gift, that didn&#x2019;t change what it really was, their teacher said, over his end&#x2013;of&#x2013;day wine. It was silver and silk spent to buy peace by an empire still rich, but also shrunken&#x2014;in spirit as well as size.</p><p>Dangerous words. His students poured wine for him. &#x201c;We have lost our rivers and mountains,&#x201d; he sang.</p><p>Ren Daiyan, fifteen years old, dreamed of glory at night, swung a bamboo sword in a wood at dawn, imagined himself the commander sent to win their lost lands back. The sort of thing that could only happen in a young man&#x2019;s imagining.</p><p>No one, Teacher Tuan said, played polo, perfecting their horsemanship, in the palace or parks of Hanjin the way they had once in Xinan&#x2019;s walled palace park or city meadows. Red&#x2013; or vermillion&#x2013;belted civil servants didn&#x2019;t pride themselves on their riding skills, or train with swords or bows, vying to best each other. They grew the nails on the little fingers of their left hands to show the world how much they disdained such things, and they kept the army commanders firmly under their thumbs. They chose military leaders from their own cultured ranks.</p><p>It was when he&#x2019;d first heard these things, the boy Daiyan remembered, tha...</p></p><h2>Fatal Error: A Novel (6) (Ali Reynolds Series)</h2><p>When an old friend is accused of murdering a cyber-sociopath who courted women over the Internet only to steal all of their money, Ali Reynolds steps in to investigate&#x2014;Jance&#x2019;s newest mystery is another <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!<br><br>Ali Reynolds begins the summer thinking her most difficult challenge will be surviving a six-week-long course as the lone forty-something female at the Arizona Police Academy&#x2014;not to mention taking over the 6 a.m. shift at her family&#x2019;s restaurant while her parents enjoy a long overdue Caribbean cruise.

A guy with attitude, one who could toss out schoolyard taunts and make them sound deadly.</p><p>&#x201c;I gave you an order.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I told you to go to hell.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali moved in then, grabbing his arm and setting up for the hip toss. Only it didn&#x2019;t work the way it was supposed to. Jose spun out of the way and suddenly Ali was the one flying through the air. She landed hard on the gym mat and with him right on top of her. The blow knocked the wind out of her and left her seeing stars. By the time Ali got her breath back, she was face down on the floor, with her wrists at her back, imprisoned in her own handcuffs. Lying there under Jose&#x2019;s full weight, she felt a rage of impotent fury flood through her. She was still there, helpless but furious, when a pair of highly polished shoes appeared in her line of vision.</p><p>&#x201c;My, my, little lady,&#x201d; Sergeant Bill Pettit said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe that&#x2019;s the way takedowns are supposed to work. He&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;s supposed to be wearing <i>your</i> handcuffs.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali Reynolds was in week four of a six-week-long course at the Arizona Police Academy. Of all the instructors there, Pettit was her hands-down least favorite. The class had started out on the fourth of August with an enrollment of one hundred seven recruits, five of whom had been women. Now they were down to a total of seventy-nine. Two of the original females had dropped out.</p><p>&#x201c;Uncuff her,&#x201d; Pettit told Jose. &#x201c;Good job.&#x201d;</p><p>The restraints came off. Jose tossed them to her, then he grabbed Ali by the elbow and helped her up.</p><p>&#x201c;No hard feelings, Oma,&#x201d; he said with a sly Cheshire grin that said he was lying. He had done it with malice and had hit her far harder than necessary, to prove a point and because he could.</p><p>To begin with, Ali&#x2019;s fellow classmates had called her &#x201c;Oma&#x201d; behind her back. Originally the word came from one of the other young recruits, a blond-haired, ruddy-faced guy whose family hailed from South Africa. In Afrikaans <i>oma</i> evidently meant something like &#x201c;old woman&#x201d; or maybe even &#x201c;grandma.&#x201d; There it probably had an air of respect about it. Here in the academy, however, most of Ali&#x2019;s classmates were fifteen to twenty years younger than she was. In context, the word was intended as an insult, meant to keep Ali in her place. To her knowledge, this was the first time she had been called that in front of one of the instructors.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why female officers end up having to resort to weapons so often,&#x201d; Pettit said. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know how to use their bodies properly. By the way, what&#x2019;s that he called you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ali&#x2019;s face flushed. &#x201c;Old Lady,&#x201d; she answered.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Old Lady, sir!&#x201d; she corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Now get your butt over to first aid. You should probably have a Band-Aid on that cut over your eye. And have them give you an ice pack. Looks to me like you&#x2019;re gonna have yourself a real shiner.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a long walk through the sweaty, overheated gym. The Phoenix metropolitan area was roasting in triple-digit heat. Although the gym&#x2019;s AC was running at full strength, it couldn&#x2019;t do more than thirty degrees below the outside temp of 116.</p><p>Ali&#x2019;s classmates stopped what they were doing and stood on their own mats to watch her walk of shame. Some of them were sympathetic, but more shared Jose&#x2019;s opinion that no self-respecting fortysomething female had any business being there, and they wanted her to quit. Blood dribbled down the side of her cheek and onto the neck of her T-shirt. She made no effort to wipe it away. If her classmates were looking for blood, she&#x2019;d give it to them.</p><p>She stepped out of the gym into glaring sunshine and brutal afternoon heat. The mountains in the distance were obscured by a haze of earth-brown smog. August was supposed to be the rainy season with monsoon rains drenching the thirsty Sonoran Desert, but so far the much-needed rains were absent although the rising humidity was not.</p><p>By the time Ali arrived at the administration office, she had made herself a promise: sometime in the next two weeks, Jose Reyes was looking at a takedown of his own.</p><p>BettyJo Hamilton, the academy&#x2019;s office manager, was also in charge of first aid. &#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; she said, peering at Ali over a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles. &#x201c;What do we have here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a little bump,&#x201d; Ali said.</p><p>After determining that no stitches were required, BettyJo applied a butterfly Band-Aid to the cut and then brought out an ice pack. &#x201c;If I were you,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d take it pretty easy for the rest of the afternoon. Let me know if you feel faint or experience any nausea.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali was glad to comply. She wasn&#x2019;t used to losing, and she didn&#x2019;t need to go back to the gym to revisit her ignominious defeat. Instead, she returned to the dorm, shut herself in her room, and lay down on the bed, with the ice pack over her eye.</p><p>Most of the academy attendees from the Phoenix area made the nightly trip home. The out-of-towners, recruits who lived too far away for a daily commute, made use of the dorm facilities. The three remaining women had rooms to themselves. Ali was especially grateful for that now. She needed some privacy to lick her wounds.</p><p>Months earlier Ali had been serving as an interim media relations consultant for the Yavapai County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department when Sheriff Gordon Maxwell had broached the idea of sending her to the academy. Once a well-known TV news anchor in L.A., Ali had returned to her hometown of Sedona, Arizona, after both her career and marriage came to sudden ends. Paul Grayson, Ali&#x2019;s philandering, late, and very much unlamented second husband, had been murdered the day before their divorce would have been final. As a divorc�e, Ali would have been in somewhat straitened financial circumstances. As Paul&#x2019;s widow, however, and through no fault of her own, she was now an extremely wealthy former anchor and aspiring cop.</p><p>After her life-changing pair of crises, Ali had spent a year or two back in her hometown, getting used to the idea of being on her own. Her parents, Bob and Edie Larson, owners of the Sugarloaf Caf�, lived there in Sedona, as did Ali&#x2019;s son, Christopher, and his fairly new and now newly pregnant bride, Athena, both of whom taught at Sedona High School.</p><p>For a while it was okay to be Bob and Edie&#x2019;s daughter and Chris&#x2019;s mom, but Ali was used to working, used to being busy. Finding herself bored to distraction, she took on the project of purchasing and remodeling the house on Manzanita Hills Road, which she shared with Leland Brooks. Mr. Brooks was her aging but entirely capable personal assistant or, as she liked to call him, her majordomo, since both he and the word seemed to hail from a more gracious, bygone era. Ali had had a boyfriend, but at her age the word <i>boyfriend</i> rankled. She liked to think of B. Simpson as her &#x201c;lover.&#x201d; When speaking to others, she referred to him as her &#x201c;significant other.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali was lying on the bed, wondering what B. would think about her showing up for Labor Day weekend with a shiner, when her cell phone rang. She checked the caller ID.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mom,&#x201d; Ali said to her mother, Edie Larson. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of your friends dropped by the Sugarloaf this afternoon, looking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; Ali said. &#x201c;Who was it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad said her name was Brenda Riley. She used to work with you in L.A.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly worked with,&#x201d; Ali replied. &#x201c;She was the anchor for a sister station in Sacramento when I was in L.A. So we were acquaintances and colleagues rather than friends. She got booted off the air about the same time I did for approximately the same reason. They thought she was too old. I haven&#x2019;t heard from her in years. What did she want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She told Dad that she really needed to see you&#x2014;that it was urgent. You know your father. He&#x2019;s such a softie, he falls for every sob story on the planet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of sob story?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just that she needed to see you&#x2014;that she was looking for help. From what he said, I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she was really looking for money.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali had found that old acquaintances did have a way of doing that, of showing up on her doorstep and asking for a loan or an outright handout. They seemed to think that since she had money and they didn&#x2019;t, she was obligated to give them some of hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Did Dad give her my number?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I chewed him out for it, but yes, he did. Worse than that, he also told her where you were and what you were doing. He said she seemed shocked that you were in the process of becoming a police officer.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali ran a finger over her rapidly swelling eye. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m shocked by that myself sometimes,&#x201d; she said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Edie Larson continued. &#x201c;From what he said, she may very well be on her way down to Phoenix to see you right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Ali suppressed a groan. Brenda Riley was pretty much the last person she needed to see right now&#x2014;especially with a cut on her eyebrow and with a black eye coming on. Brenda had been one of those irksome women who never went anywhere without being perfectly put together&#x2014;hair, makeup, and clothing. She had been almost as tall as Ali&#x2014;five ten or so&#x2014;but as far as Ali was concerned, Brenda was better-looking in every way.</p><p>&amp;ld...</p></p><h2>Delicious!: A Pumpkin Soup Story</h2><p><p>Cat, Squirrel, and Duck have a very serious problem: there are no ripe pumpkins in the garden for their favorite soup!

Can Cat and Squirrel find a way to please their fussy friend?</p><p>This follow-up to the popular <i>Pumpkin Soup</i> and <i>A Pipkin of Pepper</i> is a perfect story about a picky eater, illustrated with rich, expressive paintings in which children will find much to discover&#x2015;and it includes a recipe for pink soup!</p></p><p><p><b>Helen Cooper</b> has written and illustrated many books for children, including <i>The Bear Under the Stairs</i>, <i>Delicious!</i> and <i>Pumpkin Soup</i>, winner of the Kate Greenaway Medal and short-listed for the Kurt Maschler Award.

Disaster has struck the pumpkin patch&#x2014;no ripe pumpkins for the animals' favorite dish. The friends decide to make something new to eat, but Duck is unwilling to try either fish soup, mushroom soup, or beet soup (especially offensive because it is pink). Cat tries to trick Duck by mixing a combination of veggies and ingredients that result in a broth that is the exact color of pumpkin soup. After a tentative sip, Duck declares it "Delicious!" and order is restored in the old white cabin. The story has universal appeal&#x2014;everyone either knows, or is, a fussy eater. Readers will empathize with Duck, who is obstinate without being intolerable, and cheer for Cat and Squirrel as their patience and accommodation lead to eventual success. The illustrations are warm and rustic, and the layout does an excellent job of mixing full-page portraits and white space. A recipe for "Pink Soup" is included.

Plumb, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong></p><h2>The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomic Culture (Harvard Historical Studies)</h2><p><p>Why are there restaurants? Why would anybody consider eating to be an enjoyable leisure activity or even a serious pastime? To find the answer to these questions, we must accompany Rebecca Spang back to France in the eighteenth century, when a <i>restaurant</i> was not a place to eat but a thing to eat: a quasi-medicinal bouillon that formed an essential element of prerevolutionary France's nouvelle cuisine. This is a book about the French Revolution in taste and of the table--a book about how Parisians invented the modern culture of food, thereby changing their own social life and that of the world.</p><p>During the 1760s and 1770s, those who were sensitive and supposedly suffering made public show of their delicacy by going to the new establishments known as "restaurateurs' rooms" and there sipping their bouillons. By the 1790s, though, the table was variously seen as a place of decadent corruption or democratic solidarity. The Revolution's tables were sites for extending frugal, politically correct hospitality, and a delicate appetite was a sign of counter-revolutionary tendencies. The restaurants that had begun as purveyors of health food became symbols of aristocratic greed. In the early nineteenth century, however, the new genre of gastronomic literature worked within the strictures of the Napoleonic police state to transform the notion of restaurants and to confer star status upon oysters and champagne. Thus, the stage was set for the arrival of British and American tourists keen on discovering the mysteries of Frenchness in the capital's restaurants. From restoratives to Restoration, Spang establishes the restaurant at the very intersection of public and private in French culture--the first public place where people went to be private.</p></p><p>Rebecca L. Spang is Professor of History and Director of the Center for Eighteenth-Century Studies at Indiana University. She is the author of <i>Stuff and Money in the Time of the French Revolution</i> (Harvard).&#x201c;Spang has written an ambitious, thought-changing book. Until now, most restaurant history was pop history, filled with canned &#x2018;Eureka!&#x2019; moments and arch legend-making... Spang&#x2019;s book is an example of the new &#x2018;niche&#x2019; history, and, like the best of such books, it is rich in weird data, unsung heroes, and bizarre true stories about the making of familiar things.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Gopnik</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] pleasingly spiced history of the restaurant... How has [the] restaurant ritual come to be? And why does it have this form? Such questions are now familiar in works of cultural and social history...[but] Spang adds to the genre without falling prey to its jargon.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edward Rothstein</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This prize-winning academic historical study is a lively, engrossing, authoritative account of how the restaurant as we know it developed... Rebecca Spang is consistently perceptive about the semiotics of her theme, and as generous in her helpings of historical detail as any glutton could wish.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;No more fables about <i>ancien r�gime</i> chefs, whose aristo patrons had been guillotined or exiled in the French Revolution...an end to those anecdotes about their invention of dishes broiled on a breastplate on some Napoleonic battlefield. Because Spang reveals the restaurant&#x2019;s first true author: Mathurin Roze de Chantoiseau, &#x2018;friend of all the world,&#x2019; an entrepreneur who edited an annual business directory in which he recommended himself as the &#x2018;king&#x2019;s restauranteur&#x2019; and founder of the first &#x2018;house of health.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vera Rule</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rebecca Spang explodes a culinary myth that has lasted nearly two hundred years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Margaret Visser</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Almost every page of this decidedly scholarly though highly readable book gave me something to think about: the origins of restaurant reviewing in the early years of the 19th century, the way in which other Europeans came to identify the restaurant with the essence of French-ness itself, or the fact that in French one word&#x2015;<i>carte</i>&#x2015;does double duty for both menu and map.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Gora</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The perfect book for a time of year that celebrates, among other things, food. Historian Rebecca Spang begins with an inspired question: Why are there restaurants? To answer this, she takes the reader back a couple of centuries to France, when a restaurant was actually a thing to eat and not a place to go. Her well-researched, compelling book deservedly won several awards.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Globe and Mail</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Readers hungry for mouth-watering accounts of sumptuous meals or paeans to the glories of French cuisine will not find them here. Spang&#x2019;s focus is on the restaurant as an institution, and her history pretty much ends in the mid-19th century. Spang is far more interested in viewing restaurants in a wider social, political, and historical context. Her book is well...argued, dryly witty, and full of fascinating details.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Merle Rubin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Spang writes entertainingly, with a keen sense of humor and with no great reverence for her subject. It is a refreshing contrast to much of the overwritten adulation of restaurants that passes for criticism today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Roger Harris</b><b>, </b><b><i>Newark Star-Ledger</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The title of Rebecca L. Spang&#x2019;s scholarly yet highly accessible social history, <i>The Invention of the Restaurant</i>, causes a small jolt of surprise. For people who eat out so often that boiling a pot of spaghetti at home is a special occasion, a world without restaurants is hard to imagine. We realize, at some level, that they have not always been here, but few of us could say who invented them, or when... Much of this information is ignored in the standard food histories, and Spang&#x2019;s excavation of it makes for interesting reading, particularly because the French Revolution and its aftermath would change restaurants almost beyond recognition, into something very like the places where we go out to eat today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Pete Wells</b><b>, </b><b><i>Salon</i></b></p><h2>Storm Gold</h2><p>In 1610, while the pligrims were tip-toeing onto the rocky New England coast, Spanish adventurers and Catholic priests were riding their mules north from Santa Fe in a quest for gold and baptisms. <p> One of the last adn largest Spanish settlements was located on what is now the Ute Indian Reservation at Rock Creek.

He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrifice&#x2014;and pioneering surgery&#x2014;he recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir.<br> <br>Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Wooden&#x2019;s death at age ninety-nine.<br> <br>Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended. He eventually won an Emmy Award and other accolades for broadcasting and was recognized as a leading media pundit.<br> <br>John Wooden once said that no greatness ever came without sacrifice. Nothing better illustrates this saying than the real story of Walton&#x2019;s life. In his own words, <i>Back from the Dead</i> shares this dramatic story, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, his many setbacks and rebounds, and his ultimate triumph as the toughest of champions.</p><p>Bill Walton was NCAA player of the year at UCLA from 1972 to 1974, when UCLA set an NCAA record eighty-eight consecutive-game winning streak. A former NBA Champion and MVP, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and selected as one of the NBA&#x2019;s Fifty Greatest Players ever. He has also had a successful award-winning broadcasting career with ABC, ESPN, NBC, MSNBC, CBS, Turner, and Fox, among others. He currently resides in his hometown of San Diego with his family.

It&#x2019;s just too hard. It hurts too much. Why should I continue? What&#x2019;s the point in going on? I have been down so long now, I have no idea which way anywhere is anymore. There&#x2019;s no reason to believe that tomorrow is going to be any better.<br> <br>If I had a gun, I would use it.<br> <br>The light has gone out of my life, and there&#x2019;s no sound, either. Not even in my spirit and soul, where at least there has always been music.<br> <br>I have been living on the floor for most of the last two and a half years, unable to move, unable to get up. I&#x2019;ve cut myself off from Jerry, Bob, Neil, and the rest, just as I&#x2019;ve disconnected from most everybody and everything else. The only people I see, talk to, or hear from are the few who refuse to leave me alone&#x2014;my wife, Lori; my brother Bruce; our four sons; the most obstinate of my closest friends, like Andy Hill, Jim Gray, my guys in the Grateful Dead&#x2014;and the one person I refuse to leave alone, John Wooden, now almost one hundred years old. Everybody else has been turned away. My mom doesn&#x2019;t even know about any of this. She only gets the good news.<br> <br>Lori always says my mind is like a slot machine: you never know how the spinning wheels are going to align.<br> <br>The wheel is turning and you can&#x2019;t slow down,<br> <br>You can&#x2019;t let go, and you can&#x2019;t hold on,<br> <br>You can&#x2019;t go back, and you can&#x2019;t stand still,<br> <br>If the thunder don&#x2019;t get you, then the lightning will.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve lived with pain for most of my life, but pain has never been my entire life. It&#x2019;s in my spine now, and radiating everywhere from it. It has taken me down like never before. And it just won&#x2019;t let me be.<br> <br>What to some is pain, to me is really just fatigue. I love and live for that fatigue and the soreness that comes with it, when you&#x2019;ve pushed yourself relentlessly up and over another long, hard climb&#x2014;the longer and harder the better&#x2014;and met the toughest challenges imaginable, fighting against gravity and exhaustion, even when one more push seems impossible, until you reach the top, and the destination of euphoria, and you throw your arms over your head in a wild explosion of ecstasy and celebration&#x2014;a high-altitude climax that you&#x2019;re sure will last forever. There is nothing like it.<br> <br>But this time is different&#x2014;real different.<br> <br>I was inspired early on by George Bernard Shaw, who challenged us all, as we approach the scrap heap of life, to become &#x201c;a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the way it has always gone for me, as a young boy growing up in San Diego, chasing my basketball dreams at UCLA, then Portland, with my hometown Clippers, and finally in Boston. It was more of the same later on, out on the broadcasting and business road for more than twenty years. It&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve gone to more than 859 Grateful Dead shows. It&#x2019;s really all been one show that never ends. It&#x2019;s also why, when I&#x2019;m not at a Dead show, or not involved with basketball or business, I am at my happiest and best when riding high, up on my bike, dripping and soaking with sweat under the hot, burning sun, turning the crank and pushing the wheel endlessly over, time after time after time. Mile after countless mile across the warm, dry desert, along the twisting, jagged coast, or winding up a mountain, spinning, twirling, rolling, drifting, dreaming, celebrating&#x2014;the chance of being on yet another long, hard climb, the longer and harder the better.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t count the number of these long, hard climbs I&#x2019;ve made over the years. But I do know that while the longest and hardest have taken me the highest, I never was able to get that euphoria to last very long. Every time, way too soon after I&#x2019;d reached the top&#x2014;so tantalizingly close to perfection&#x2014;the dancing, dreaming, and celebrating that I was sure would never end would come to a crashing halt. Somehow, some way, my wheels would stop turning; I&#x2019;d lose control and wind up skidding or skulking off the road, collapsing into a crumpled, helpless, hopeless heap&#x2014;where everything would end up broken.<br> <br>But with every inevitable catastrophic collapse, at least I always had the music&#x2014;the one thing that never stopped. The songs, the stories, the dreams, the hope, would always get me through.<br> <br>I realized at a very early age that all the songs of my heroes were really just songs of my own. And that they were written for me, to me, about me, and about everything that happened in my life. Somehow, some way, they all knew. About everything. The Dead, Dylan, Neil,&nbsp;the Johns&#x2014;Lennon and Fogerty&#x2014;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, the Stones, Carlos, the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Jimmy Cliff, Jackson Browne, and ultimately the Eagles and Bruce Springsteen.<br> <br>It fell apart, and it breaks my heart to think about how close we came.<br> <br>So close, so many times. It all could have been so perfect but for the fiery crash that would ruin everything, every time. UCLA and the 88-game winning streak that should have been a perfect 105&#x2014;what could and should have been, ultimately ending in disappointment, shame, and embarrassment. The Trail Blazers, Clippers, Celtics&#x2014;more of the same. It all could have been so right; it all should have been so perfect.<br> <br>When life looks like Easy Street, there is danger at your door.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s never a good idea, Coach Wooden preached, to measure yourself by what you have done rather than by what you could or should have been able to do.<br> <br>But at least my crashes&#x2014;painful, miserable, and frequent as they were&#x2014;always eventually led to new beginnings and the next long, hard climb. And on each new climb, I had to try to remember to learn perspective, relativity, patience, and tolerance, and remind myself of the fragility of it all. You&#x2019;d think I would know by now. But the pattern kept repeating. Each new challenge filled me with new confidence that this time would be different. And that the joys of this long, hard climb would finally last forever.<br> <br>Coach Wooden was presciently brilliant on so many fronts. Sadly it took me too long to realize it. When I played for him, I was a teenager&#x2014;seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old. Most of what he said in those days seemed ridiculous. He would constantly remind me then, and continue to tell me over the next four decades, &#x201c;Walton, you are the slowest learner I have ever had!&#x201d;<br> <br>Coach Wooden was an English teacher by profession; he had young men under his athletic supervision in the afternoon. Coach was charged by his father, Joshua, to &#x201c;make each day your masterpiece.&#x201d; Coach dutifully passed that wisdom on to all of his students. For his certificate of currency, relevancy, and authenticity, he wrote his master&#x2019;s thesis on how to teach poetry. And while Coach had his poets&#x2014;Shakespeare, Tennyson, Frost, Longfellow, Whitman, Dailey&#x2014;I have mine: Jerry Garcia, John Lennon, Neil Young, Bob Dylan. Maybe if Coach had listened more closely, he would have realized that my guys were singing the same songs as his. I&#x2019;m sure he felt the same way about me&#x2014;listening more closely and all.<br> <br>These days, it feels like none of them are singing anymore at all&#x2014;Coach&#x2019;s masters or mine. The music has finally, unexpectedly, tragically, totally stopped. I am buried too far down. It&#x2019;s just too dark down here. And the climb is finally too long and too darn hard.<br> <br>By the numbers, I am the most injured athlete in the history of sports. My injuries are not the gravest, but they are mine. They never go away. Sadly, they are the kinds of injuries that no one could see happen or ultimately understand&#x2014;the way the world witnessed Joe Theismann&#x2019;s leg snapping like a twig, endlessly replayed on TV.<br> <br>And while I am a fighter and a player in the game of life, I am not much more than that. The true champions and heroes in our world are the freedom fighters struggling for truth and justice, the ones who through the ages gave up everything&#x2014;their limbs, their minds, their freedom, their lives&#x2014;so that all of us could have a chance to chase our dreams.<br> <br>For me, the dream has too often devolved into the nightmare of endlessly repetitive and constant pain, agony, and guilt. Thirty-seven orthopedic surgeries, nearly all stemming from my malformed feet&#x2014;my faulty foundation, which led to the endless string of stress fractures, which ultimately brought on the whole mess I&#x2019;m in now. The insidious, ever-widening fractures in my feet, made so much worse by the fact that they were undetectable, even by machines, so that practically everyone had doubts that they ever even really existed. Confusing and confounding doubts that even consumed me.<br> <br>The band was packed and gone<br> <br>Were they ever even here at all?<br> <br>I was born with structural, congenital defects in my feet, something that I learned way too late in life. My feet were not built to last&#x2014;or to play basketball. My skeletal, structural foundation&#x2014;inflexible and rigid&#x2014;could not absorb the endless stress and impact of running, jumping, turning, twisting, and pounding for twenty-six years. Those fractures, tiny at first, were buried deep inside the bones, breaking from the inside out. Those bones in my feet and legs would ultimately fail just from playing the game I lived and loved, forced apart like earth&#x2019;s tectonic plates, scraping and torqueing along a fault line.<br> <br>I eventually ground my lower extremities down to dust.<br> <br>As each long, hard climb became more impossibly difficult, the pain that I always thought was just part of life and the price of commitment and perfection would ultimately send me limping off the road into that miserable, useless scrap heap.<br> <br>Yes, the external pressures on me to play&#x2014;when the crippling pain in my feet would tell me to stop&#x2014;were enormous and very real. But ultimately the fault was mine. I was too weak to stand up for myself.<br> <br>Won&#x2019;t you try just a little bit harder? Couldn&#x2019;t you try just a little bit more?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Tryin&#x2019; to get just a little bit farther than you&#x2019;ve gone before.<br> <br>Chasing my dreams was devolving into the deteriorating state of tormented conflict that has come to define my life.<br> <br>I grew up in San Diego. It was perfect. My life was wonderful&#x2014;great families; excellent schools, teachers, and coaches; it was sunny and eighty degrees every day. I assumed it was the same everywhere, for everyone.<br> <br>Cursed with my bad feet and a lifelong speech impediment, I grew up thinking that everybody&#x2019;s feet hurt all the time and that only the lucky ones were able to talk. I was twenty-one before it ever occurred to me that there might be people who didn&#x2019;t have my best interests at heart.<br> <br>And then I joined the NBA.<br> <br>I was totally unprepared for a professional life outside the shelter of my family, my friends, my teachers, my coaches, and California. My parents loved me more than they cared about themselves. They taught my two brothers, my sister, and me to speak up and out, and to take action to make things better and right. It never crossed my mind that this could ever lead to problems.<br> <br>Both my parents were college graduates and professionals. My dad was a social worker, adult educator, and music teacher; my mom was our town&#x2019;s librarian. I was a top student. I loved school. But because of my profound, limiting, and shamefully embarrassing stuttering problem, I learned to live and love life by myself. I loved to read, study history, write, and immerse my spirit and soul in all kinds of music. For the longest time we didn&#x2019;t have a TV, couldn&#x2019;t afford one. When finally we saved up enough money to buy one, my mom, who was in charge of the finances, declared under relentless pressure from the children that while we did now have enough money to buy a TV, she had done extensive research at the library and determined that there was nothing on TV worth watching&#x2014;so we weren&#x2019;t going to get one.<br> <br>When I was twelve I discovered, at a friend&#x2019;s house, that basketball was on TV. With that revelation came the staggering conclusion that my mom was not right about everything.<br> <br>I had started playing basketball when I was eight and immediately fell in love with it because of my first coach, Rocky&#x2014;our local fireman. When I was ten, I discovered the Lakers and the NBA on the radio, brought to life by Chick Hearn. Rocky and Chick were God to me. They defined my reality, creating a world that was not only fun but incredibly exciting. They had the ability to paint a masterpiece every night. And they delivered.<br> <br>Basketball is the most perfect of all games. All you have to do is wait for the opening tip; then it&#x2019;s, Who&#x2019;s got a game? Who&#x2019;s in shape? Who can play? Who really wants this? It also allows someone who might be less naturally gifted than another to always have the chance to win, by outthinking and working smarter than the other guy, especially if teamed with equally smart, dedicated, and determined dreamers.<br> <br>Rocky ultimately turned out to be my best coach. Rocky&#x2014;like John Wooden, Denny Crum, Lenny Wilkens, Jack Ramsay, Gene Shue, Paul Silas, Don Chaney, K. C. Jones, and Red Auerbach&#x2014;never really coached basketball. They all coached life. I learned early on that basketball was life, and that every possession of the ball provided unlimited opportunities to make a powerful, positive impact and contribution to our goal, a realization that I try to apply to everything I do in my life.<br> <br>In basketball&#x2014;like life&#x2014;if your team is well coached, well conditioned, reasonably intelligent, and totally determined to make a positive, consistent contribution, you just might be able to find a way to beat anybody, maybe everybody. Or at least to have the chance to succeed on any long, hard climb.<br> <br>Despite my bad feet and cursed speech, things were going fine for me until I was fourteen. I was 6'1", maybe 110 pounds, and playing basketball every minute that I could. Then one day in the summer of &#x2019;67, down at the Helix High gym, I was playing against some really old guys&#x2014;they must have been in their thirties. I was having a big day, just torching them, and they didn&#x2019;t like it. So they took me down with a high-low, tearing up my left knee. They stood over me, laughing.<br> <br>Bob Dylan wrote: &#x201c;When I was down, you just stood there grinning.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a few months of rest and rehabilitation during which my knee didn&#x2019;t get any better, I was wheeled into surgery in the early fall for my first operation. I was fourteen years old. Afterward the doctor told me, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know how this is going to play out, Billy. Just go home and lie down for a few months and we&#x2019;ll hope and pray for the best.&#x201d;<br> <br>Things were never the same again. I dutifully went to bed, and when I got up three months later I was six and a half inches taller&#x2014;but only five pounds heavier. My parents were aghast; none of my clothes fit anymore. But my coach, now Gordon Nash, was ecstatic.<br> <br>I loved basketball from the very beginning&#x2014;because of Rocky, because of the nature of the game, the speed, strategy, execution, repetition, running, jumping, and sweating. And I really loved the results&#x2014;like winning.<br> <br>In my first varsity season as a Helix junior in 1968&#x2013;69, we won our last sixteen games. The next time my team lost was about five and a half years later, midway through my senior season at UCLA.<br> <br>I lived to play on winning teams. At UCLA, I was All-America, Academic All-America, and College Player of the Year three times each.

A thoughtful, powerful, psychologically acute novel that deserves to break Archer Mayor out the midlist, <i>The Sniper's Wife</i> draws the reader inside the mind of a protagonist who justly deserves the focused attention Mayor pays him. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Archer Mayor lives in Newfane, Vermont.</p><h2>The Encyclopaedia of Celtic Wisdom: The Celtic Shaman&#39;s Sourcebook</h2><p>A guide to Celtic spiritual traditions.

It wasn&#x2019;t until 1951, while searching for books to read to his young son, Fritz, that he began writing children&#x2019;s stories. His classic Tales of Magic series started with the best-selling <i>Half Magic,</i> published in 1954. In each of his books he carefully acknowledges his indebtedness to E. Nesbit, whom he considered the best children&#x2019;s writer of all time&#x2014;&#x201c;so that any child who likes my books and doesn&#x2019;t know hers may be led back to the master of us all.&#x201d;<p><b>1</b><br><b>James Begins</b></p><p><i>I know people who say</i> they can read any kind of book except an &#x201c;I&#x201d; book, and sometimes I think I agree with them. When I say &#x201c;I&#x201d; books, I mean the kind where somebody tells the story, and it starts out, &#x201c;Little did I think when I first saw the red house how large it would loom in my life.&#x201d; And later on, the person sees a sinister stranger digging a grave in the garden and he says, &#x201c;If I had only remembered to telephone the police next morning, seven murders might have been averted.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura and I often run into books like that, and Laura always says she holds the people who tell those stories in utter contempt, which is her way of saying they give her a pain. If we saw a sinister stranger digging a grave in our garden, we would remember to telephone the police, all right. And when we first saw <i>our</i> red house, we <i>knew</i> how large it would loom.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura is my sister, and not bad as sisters go. Sometimes she has quite sound ideas.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of her ideas was that we should tell the story this way, &#x201c;I&#x201d; book or not. Because the things that happened that winter happened to six of us (not counting parents), and the way they happened was different for each person. The way we felt about it was different for each person, too. So it is only right that each one should tell his part.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura says I should begin the whole thing because I have a well-organized mind. I am not boasting. That about my mind is what Mrs. Van Nest said one day. Mrs. Van Nest is our teacher, and sometimes her ideas are quite sound, too. She lets us do book reports on any book we like, and it doesn&#x2019;t have to be on the list.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am beginning this story, and after that each one will tell what happened to him or her, as the case may be, and each one will tell it in his own way. Only we have made one rule, which is not to tell about the days when nothing happened, because who would want to read about them? And another rule is not to put in things that don&#x2019;t mean anything and are just there to try to make it more exciting. Like saying, &#x201c;There I stood, my heart beating.&#x201d; Naturally your heart would be beating. Otherwise you wouldn&#x2019;t be standing there; you&#x2019;d be lying down dead.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are going to stick to the facts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first important fact about me is that my name is James Alexander Martin and I am in grade six-one-A, Mrs. Van Nest&#x2019;s homeroom. Kip and Laura and Lydia are all in my class, too, but Gordy is in six-one-B and has to have Miss Wilson. Wow, do I pity him!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We try to be specially kind to Gordy, for that and other reasons, but sometimes we forget. Gordy is not a person who makes it easy for other people always to remember. Sometimes we have to be firm with him for his own good, but we try never to stoop to physical violence. Physical violence never solved anything in the world, we all realize. But sometimes with Gordy we forget that, too, or at least Kip and I do. Girls are soft.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wonder why Laura and I are in the same class in school, it is because we are the same age, being twins. But we do not look alike, or think alike, either, particularly about the magic, only that comes later.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my other sister Deborah, she is a mere babe, just starting the first grade, and by rights she shouldn&#x2019;t come into this story at all. But rights have never meant a great deal to Deborah.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story I&#x2019;m talking about began one day in fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it really began long before that, way back at the beginning of the summer, when Laura and I and our family first moved into the red house on Silvermine Road. Before that we lived in New York City.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red house has a well in the garden, and the day we moved in a girl called Lydia Green, who lives in a funny big old place up the road, told us that it was a wishing well. Of course I knew better than to believe that. But Laura would believe anything, or try to.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, some very strange things did happen that summer. A lot of quite good wishes came true and some pretty keen good turns got done. That was the way the well was supposed to work. Selfish wishes didn&#x2019;t mean a thing to it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got our heart&#x2019;s desire in the end, too, just like in that book <i>The Wonderful Garden</i> by E. Nesbit that Laura is so crazy about. It is not a bad book, by the way. A boy runs away and so does a tiger, and a portrait comes to life. The ending is nifty, if you&#x2019;re young enough to believe in magic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;m not sure whether I am young enough or not. Mostly I think not. Magic doesn&#x2019;t seem at all like the kind of thing that <i>would</i> be true, when you come to think of it. Still, neither do airplanes and electric lights and outer space, when you come to think of <i>them.</i> And it&#x2019;s hard to explain the things that happened that summer any other way. Or the things that have been happening since, either. Of course it may all be a coincidence, the way Kip keeps saying.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kip is a boy called Christopher, only he never is. Never is called that, I mean. He lives on our road, too, across from Lydia. He is a good kid, and just about my best friend, I guess.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lydia and Laura and I were in on the magic (if that&#x2019;s what it was) from the beginning. Gordy didn&#x2019;t come into it till later in the summer. We didn&#x2019;t <i>ask</i> him in exactly, but once he was there, we didn&#x2019;t mind. Sometimes his ideas are every bit as sound as ours. All he needs is to be curbed once in a while, and shoved back on the right road. He is the victim of an unfortunate environment. His mother is rich. His full name is Gordon T. Witherspoon III.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first made the wish about our heart&#x2019;s desire, we weren&#x2019;t quite sure what our heart&#x2019;s desire was, but when we got it, we knew. What it turned out to be was a little old house in the woods, all our own, to have for our secret clubhouse. How we found the house in the first place, and what we found in it, and exactly how it got to be ours is another story, and if you want to read that story, you will have to get a book called <i>Magic or Not?</i> that tells all about it. But we did not write that book ourselves; so it does not have all our thoughts in it, the way this book will.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part about the heart&#x2019;s desire came right at the end of the summer, and after that the magic (if it <i>was</i> magic) seemed to be played out. At least we made quite a few perfectly good wishes on the well and they never came true, no matter how noble. That was all right with me, if that was how the well wanted things to end. But the girls said it was probably just resting and would start up again one day when we least expected it. You never can tell with magic. Or not, as the case may be.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then suddenly it was fall, and for Laura and me there was a new school to get used to, and learning a new teacher&#x2019;s ways and how to circumscribe them, if that is the word I mean, and that took up all our thoughts, for a while.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Football season began, too; so Kip and I were mainly too busy to bother with girls. I play end, but not very often, being light though rangy. Baseball is my game.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laura and Lydia do not understand the true importance of football, or baseball either, but that is their female folly. As you grow older, the sexes grow farther and farther apart, I find. It is all part of maturing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the old group did find time to meet now and then in the house in the woods and have secret conclaves, though there wasn&#x2019;t very much to conclave <i>for,</i> now that the magic was a thing of the past.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that&#x2019;s how we got into the habit of leaving Gordy out; so we&#x2019;d have something to be secret about. We even had a mysterious secret sign. When it seemed like a good day for a meeting, one of us would hold up one finger, or two, along toward the end of last period. One if all five, two if without Gordy. Lately it was getting to be two most of the time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Gordy would come into the woods looking for us, but when he found us in the secret clubhouse without him, he never seemed to bear any grudge. That is one of the good things about Gordy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were always sorry afterward when this happened, and the fact that Gordy didn&#x2019;t seem to get hurt or mad at us made us feel sorrier. You would think that would make us be nicer to him from then on, but it didn&#x2019;t. The sorrier we felt each time, the more we went on leaving him out the next. That is the way people are. I do not think this is right, but it is true all the same. Though unfortunate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular day Kip had held up two fingers just as the last bell rang, and we had all nodded, and when we marched out, everybody but Lydia got away quick without being spotted by the enemy. And Lydia crossed her fingers and told Gordy she had to go to the dentist. Which was not a lie really, because she <i>did</i> have to go. Only not that day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now there we all were (except you know whom) sitting on the front stoop of the secret house, because it was getting to be late September and the rooms inside were cold. But in front, the woods have been cut away to let the sun through.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydia had a pencil in her hand and a sketchbook in her lap, the way she does all the time now that she knows she has talent. It is wonderful how learning that she has talent has changed that girl. Maybe learning to make friends has had something to do with it, too. When we first met her, she was plain ornery, always doing crazy things just to be different, and quarreling with everybody. She is still ornery once in a while, and she and I still argue some. But she is a good kid, for a girl.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today she was amusing us by doing caricatures of each one. The ones she did of Laura and Kip were awfully funny, but she didn&#x2019;t get me right at all. My chin doesn&#x2019;t stick out like that, at least not that far.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we&#x2019;d finished arguing about my chin, she started a portrait of herself, all long tangled blond hair with a scowl peeking through. Then she made a face at it and tore it up. &#x201c;If you ask me,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s time something started happening around here. I&#x2019;m used to school again. The sameness has set in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Halloween next month,&#x201d; Kip reminded her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the party in the gym.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Bobbing for apples!&#x201d; Lydia was scornful. &#x201c;And that old decoration committee. Black crepe paper cats on the walls; you&#x2019;d think they could at least think up something original. Why didn&#x2019;t they put <i>me</i> on it; <i>I&#x2019;d</i> freeze their marrow for them!&#x201d; And she drew a truly horrendous witch on the next page of her sketch pad.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;If you ask <i>me,</i>&#x201d; said Laura, &#x201c;I think the trouble with us is we miss the magic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody groaned, because we were all secretly trying not to think about that. But Laura is a great one for bringing hidden thoughts out into the open.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We said this was going to be our secret witches&#x2019; den where we&#x2019;d have midnight meetings and plan our secret spells,&#x201d; she went on now. &#x201c;We were going to do good turns to the whole town. But not a single magic thing&#x2019;s happened, and pretty soon it&#x2019;ll be too cold to come here anymore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be warm again in the spring,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe the magic goes to sleep in the winter, like woodchucks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;In books it&#x2019;s almost always summer when the magic starts working,&#x201d; put in Kip. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost always summer vacation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So we won&#x2019;t be distracted from our lessons, I suppose,&#x201d; said Lydia bitterly. &#x201c;As if being distracted weren&#x2019;t just what we need!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Has anybody said anything to the well lately?&#x201d; I wondered. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s just sitting there waiting for a friendly word.&#x201d; After all, if we were going to believe in the magic (and everyone was talking suddenly as if we were), we might as well be efficient about it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No, and I don&#x2019;t think we ought to,&#x201d; said Laura. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re supposed to wait, no matter how long it takes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s not talk about it,&#x201d; I said. Because there is nothing so maddening as talking about something when you can&#x2019;t do a single thing about it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I think we <i>ought</i> to talk,&#x201d; said Laura. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ve been silent about it, and each going his own way, long enough.&#x201d; She turned to Lydia. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say a thing when James asked if anybody&#x2019;d been talking to the well lately, and neither did Kip. Have you been wishing on the sly?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I did think of giving it a look and a few words the other day,&#x201d; Lydia admitted. &#x201c;Just sort of generally about getting a move on. But I thought better of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I almost asked it to help with my history test,&#x201d; said Kip. &#x201c;And that would have been unselfish, because think how my parents would feel if I flunked. I didn&#x2019;t do it, though. Maybe I should have. I only got a seventy-one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Laura. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a good thing you didn&#x2019;t. I think if we start pestering it, it might get cross and take longer waking up than it would have, even. Or go all wrong when it does. I think we ought to swear a secret oath in blood not to go <i>near</i> the well until we&#x2019;re absolutely sure it&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody was willing, probably because even merely swearing a secret oath is <i>sort</i> of a secret adventure. Kip had his scout knife handy, pricks were made, and the fatal oath duly sworn.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;There,&#x201d; said Laura, sucking a finger. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s settled. Now when the well&#x2019;s ready, it&#x2019;ll tell us so. There&#x2019;ll be a sign.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What kind of a sign?&#x201d; Kip wondered. &#x201c;Will it go guggle guggle guggle? Or shoot up like a geyser?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Something&#x2019;ll happen,&#x201d; said Laura. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound in the woods.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody jumped. But it wasn&#x2019;t the kind of sound magic would make starting up at all. It was a crackling and a swishing and a thudding that could add up to only one thing: Gordy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gordy runs through the woods, branches don&#x2019;t mean a thing to him, or noise either. As a Commando, his name would be mud. He does get where he&#x2019;s going, though. And he does not seem to mind the scratches.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nbs...</p></p><h2>At Freddie&#39;s</h2><p>A novel centered around the Temple Stage School and its matriarch, Freddie Wentworth, focuses on the lives of child actors trained and represented by the school, in a novel appearing for the first time in a U.S. paperback edition. Reprint.</p><p>Age has indeed withered the proprietress of London's Temple School for child actors, but custom has yet to stale her infinite, cadging variety. Freddie--born Frieda Wentworth--is Penelope Fitzgerald's most marvelous sacred monster, a woman insanely devoted to her art. Over several decades she has foiled debt collectors, creditors, and bailiffs at every turn. What matter if Freddie's Covent Garden redoubt is freezing and falling apart, her own office-cum-bedroom a haven for must and dust, mold and mothballs? When one would-be financier has the temerity to display a balance sheet, she orders him to put it away, "in the tone she used to the local flasher." After all, this force of theatrical nature can always rely on actors and theaters for desperate, last-minute donations. On the other hand, it <i>is</i> 1963, and the school is threatened by others specializing in film and TV training, but so far Freddie is sticking to her Shakespearean guns.<p> The Temple's permanent staff consists of an unskilled handyman and Freddie's assistant and dresser, the possibly malevolent Miss Blewett. Its acting coaches include a man who's made his career out of understudying Nana, the dog-nurse in <i>Peter Pan</i>. Needless to say, the students are not impressed. To further trim expenses, Freddie has hired two new teachers from Northern Ireland. One, Hannah Graves, is qualified; the other, Pierce Carroll, decidedly not--but Freddie hires him for other reasons: "She had heard in his remarks the weak, but pure, voice of complete honesty. She was not sure that she had ever heard it before, and thought it would be worth studying as a curiosity." These two innocents are in academic charge of the young thespians, an egomaniacal, mostly mendacious lot. (In a stage school, after all, insincerity is a good thing.) But Freddie's does house one genius: 9-year-old, unknowable Jonathan Kemp. Even his guinea pig inherits his bad luck, and is soon devoured by one of the theater district's roving felines. Jonathan seems destined to be overshadowed by Mattie Stewart (later Stewart Matthews), a showoff who at least has the grace--even if it is manifested in spurts of violence--to know himself inferior. Meanwhile, we watch Pierce fall in love, hopelessly, with his colleague. Alas, he hasn't a chance against the dissipated actor Boney Lewis, though Hannah tries not to destroy him: "At the corner, she gave him a hug and a kiss, as one does to a cousin, or to the inconsolable." </p><p> <i>At Freddie's</i>, Penelope Fitzgerald's 1982 parable of the talents, constantly shifts between such despair and high comedy. Many Fitzgerald-philes feel that she reached her apex in her three European novels--<i>Innocence</i>, <i>The Beginning of Spring</i>, and <i>The Blue Flower</i>. In fact, she had already arrived there with this perfect novel of ideas, ideals, and oddities. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>A jewel of a book. <i>Daily Mail</i> <br>It is the 1960s, in London s West End, and Freddie is the formidable proprietress of the Temple Stage School, which supplies child actors for everything from Shakespeare to musicals to the Christmas pantomime. Of unknown age and provenance, Freddie is a skirt-swathed enigma a woman who by sheer force of character and single-minded thrust has turned herself and her school into a national institution. Anyone who is anyone must know Freddie. <br>Filled with unique and hilarious insights into the theatrical world, <i>At Freddie s</i> is a beguiling story for those of us who sometimes pretend to be something we are not. <br> Love, fear, class, ambition, even death it's all in here, but so elegantly presented that you've finished your plate before you even think to ask about the ingredients. National Public Radio <br>PENELOPE FITZGERALD (1916 2000) was one of the most elegant and distinctive voices in British fiction. She won the National Book Critics Circle Award in fiction for The Blue Flower, the Booker Prize for Offshore, and three of her novels The Bookshop, The Gate of Angels, and The Beginning of Spring were short-listed for the Booker Prize. <br>"</p><h2>Heirs of Empire</h2><p>Restoring the empire that had been destroyed forty-five years earlier, Emperor Colin finds problems in the genocidal Achuutani and in his children Sean and Harriet, who have been marooned on a hostile planet. Original.</p><p>David Weber is one of the top science fiction writers of the 1990s whose acclaimed Honor Harrington series has gained him a devoted and dedicated readership. His many other books include the epic fantasies Oath of Swords and The War God&#39;s Own (also Baen).As guilty pleasures go, the sequel to The Armageddon Inheritance probably isn't the equal of a cholesterol-laden hot fudge sundae?but it's close. In this installment, Humanity's Emperor Colin has to deal with subjects who want to overthrow him and a superbomb so powerful it makes an atomic weapon look like just another Fourth of July sparkler. Meanwhile, the heirs to the throne are marooned on a distant planet, where, in addition to worrying about how to get home, they somehow have to remedy a religious conflict they've managed to set off. Weber combines science fiction, fantasy and a sly sense of humor into a novel that may be a tad silly but is definitely a whole lot of fun. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Buddhism for Mothers: A Calm Approach to Caring for Yourself and Your Children</h2><p>Addressing the often-overlooked spiritual needs of mothers, this book discusses Buddhist teachings as applied to the everyday challenges and stresses of raising children. Offered are ways for mothers to reconnect with their inner selves and become calmer and happier&#x2014;with the recognition that a happier mother will be a better parent. This realistic look at motherhood acknowledges the sorrows as well as the joys of mothering and offers real and achievable coping strategies for mothers to renew their lives on a deep level.<br></p><p><b>Sarah Napthali</b> is a practicing Buddhist with more than 10 years of experience applying Buddhist principles to her everyday life. She is the mother of two small children and has contributed to the Australian magazines <i>Women's Weekly</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>Mother and Baby</i>, and <i>Australian Parents</i>.This empathetic book is written by a practicing Buddhist mother for other mothers who face daily assaults on their desire to be calm and centered. Napthali explains early on that she&#39;s a mother, not a spiritual leader, and that she lives her Buddhism each day, and it is this practical, caring persona that narrator Rebecca Macauley brings to life. With her youthful-sounding Australian voice, Macauley enlivens the many anecdotes Napthali includes--stories of mothers trying to be mindful of their parenting mission in a world that offers constant distractions and frustrations, and tales that show how mothers who strive to be extraordinarily nurturing often fail to care for themselves. Macauley&#39;s contemplative voice nicely expresses Napthali&#39;s many soothing insights into the gifts that Buddhism offers mothers.

Some of the people who come to Count D's pet shop are given children instead of pets, or pets who transform into children overnight. These customers manage to suspend their disbelief and their qualms when they learn that the children have magical qualities. They transform their owners' lives into something both astonishing and bittersweet. A mother is killed by her ex-husband, but miraculously saves her child's life in the process. A man and a magical dog save the life of a woman he loves, and in doing so they both die and are reborn. In an extra flashback story, Count D's grandfather provides a special pet for Hitler's lover Eva Braun in the form of a child with blond hair and blue eyes. The black-and-white artwork is eye-catching and dramatic, propelling the story forward. However, some of the text is printed directly over the graphics, rather than in thought or word balloons, and is difficult to read and easy to miss. This is an unusual manga that will leave its readers both satisfied and perturbed.<i>&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The resulting piece of extraordinary protest writing, &#x201c;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&#x201d; was widely circulated and published in numerous periodicals. After the conclusion of the campaign and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, King further developed the ideas introduced in the letter in&nbsp;<i>Why We Can&#x2019;t Wait,</i>&nbsp;which tells the story of African American activism in the spring and summer of 1963. During this time, Birmingham, Alabama, was perhaps the most racially segregated city in the United States, but the campaign launched by King, Fred Shuttlesworth, and others demonstrated to the world the power of nonviolent direct action.<br>&nbsp;<br>Often applauded as King&#x2019;s most incisive and eloquent book,&nbsp;<i>Why We Can&#x2019;t Wait</i>&nbsp;recounts the Birmingham campaign in vivid detail, while underscoring why 1963 was such a crucial year for the civil rights movement. Disappointed by the slow pace of school desegregation and civil rights legislation, King observed that by 1963&#x2014;during which the country celebrated the one-hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation&#x2014;Asia and Africa were &#x201c;moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence but we still creep at a horse-and-buggy pace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>King examines the history of the civil rights struggle, noting tasks that future generations must accomplish to bring about full equality, and asserts that African Americans have already waited over three centuries for civil rights and that it is time to be proactive: &#x201c;For years now, I have heard the word &#x2018;Wait!&#x2019; It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This &#x2018;Wait&#x2019; has almost always meant &#x2018;Never.&#x2019; We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that &#x2018;justice too long delayed is justice denied.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><b><b>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>&nbsp;</b>(1929&#x2013;1968), Nobel Peace Prize laureate and architect of the nonviolent civil rights movement, was among the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential figures.

It didn&#x2019;t take long after returning to Birmingham, however, to recognize the existence of a problem that made it unwise and impractical for me to go to jail before something had been done to solve it. <br> &nbsp;<br> We had been forced to change our timetable twice. We had had to make a strategic retreat until after the run-off and had lost contact with the community for several weeks. We had returned now to a city whose political power structure was divided. We had returned to find that our own people were not united. There was tremendous resistance to our program from some of the Negro ministers, businessmen and professionals in the city. This opposition did not exist because these Negroes did not want to be free. It existed for several other reasons. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Negro in Birmingham, like the Negro elsewhere in this nation, had been skillfully brainwashed to the point where he had accepted the white man&#x2019;s theory that he, as a Negro, was inferior. He wanted to believe that he was the equal of any man; but he didn&#x2019;t know where to begin or how to resist the influences that had conditioned him to take the line of least resistance and go along with the white man&#x2019;s views. He knew that there were exceptions to the white man&#x2019;s evaluation: a Ralph Bunche, a Jackie Robinson, a Marian Anderson. But to the Negro, in Birmingham and in the nation, the exception did not prove the rule. <br> &nbsp;<br> Another consideration had also affected the thinking of some of the Negro leaders in Birmingham. This was the widespread feeling that our action was illtimed, and that we should have given the new Boutwell government a chance. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had been one of the first to voice this criticism. The <i>Washington Post, </i>which covered Birmingham from the first day of our demonstrations, had editorially attacked our &#x201c;timing.&#x201d; In fact, virtually all the coverage in the national press at first had been negative, pictur ing us as irresponsible hotheads who had plunged into a situation just when Birmingham was getting ready to change overnight into Paradise. The sudden emergence of our protest seemed to give the lie to this vision. <br> &nbsp;<br> In Montgomery, during the bus boycott, and in the Albany, Georgia, campaign, we had had the advantage of a sympathetic and understanding national press from the outset. In Birmingham we did not. It is terribly difficult to wage such a battle without the moral support of the national press to counteract the hostility of local editors. The words &#x201c;bad timing&#x201d; came to be ghosts haunting our every move in Birmingham. Yet people who used this argument were ignorant of the background of our planning. They did not know we had postponed our campaign twice. They did not know our reason for attacking in time to affect Easter shopping. Above all they did not realize that it was ridiculous to speak of timing when the clock of history showed that the Negro had already suffered one hundred years of delay. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not only were many of the Negro leaders affected by the administration&#x2019;s position, but they were themselves indulging in a false optimism about what would happen to Birmingham under the new government. The situation had been critical for so many years that, I suppose, these people felt that any change represented a giant step toward the good. Many truly believed that once the influence of Bull Connor had faded, everything was going to be all right. <br> &nbsp;<br> Another reason for the opposition within the Negro community was resentment on the part of some groups and leaders because we had not kept them informed about the date we planned to begin or the strategy we would adopt. They felt that they were being pulled in on something they had no part in organizing. They did not realize that, because of the local political situation, we had been forced to keep our plans secret. <br> &nbsp;<br> We were seeking to bring about a great social change which could only be achieved through unified effort. Yet our community was divided. Our goals could never be attained in such an atmosphere. It was decided that we would conduct a whirlwind campaign of meetings with organizations and leaders in the Negro community, to seek to mobilize every key person and group behind our movement. <br> &nbsp;<br> Along with members of my staff, I began addressing numerous groups representing a cross section of our people in Birmingham. I spoke to 125 business and professional people at a call meeting in the Gaston Building. I talked to a gathering of two hundred ministers. I met with many smaller groups, during a hectic oneweek schedule. In most cases, the atmosphere when I entered was tense and chilly, and I was aware that there was a great deal of work to be done. <br> &nbsp;<br> I went immediately to the point, explaining to the business and professional men why we had been forced to proceed without letting them know the date in advance. I dealt with the argument of timing. To the ministers I stressed the need for a social gospel to supplement the gospel of individual salvation. I suggested that only a &#x201c;dry as dust&#x201d; religion prompts a minister to extol the glories of heaven while ignoring the social conditions that cause men an earthly hell. I pleaded for the projection of strong, firm leadership by the Negro minister, pointing out that he is freer, more independent, than any other person in the community. I asked how the Negro would ever gain his freedom without the guidance, support and inspiration of his spiritual leaders. <br> &nbsp;<br> I challenged those who had been persuaded that I was an &#x201c;outsider.&#x201d; I pointed out that Fred Shuttlesworth&#x2019;s Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights was an affiliate of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and that the Shuttlesworth group had asked S.C.L.C. to come to Birmingham, and that as president of S.C.L.C., I had come in the interests of aiding an S.C.L.C. affiliate. <br> &nbsp;<br> I expanded further on the weary and worn &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; charge, which we have faced in every community where we have gone to try to help. No Negro, in fact, no American, is an outsider when he goes to any community to aid the cause of freedom and justice. No Negro anywhere, regardless of his social standing, his financial status, his prestige and position, is an outsider so long as dignity and decency are denied to the humblest black child in Mississippi, Alabama or Georgia. <br> &nbsp;<br> The amazing aftermath of Birmingham, the sweeping Negro Revolution, revealed to people all over the land that there are no outsiders in all these fifty states of America. When a police dog buried his fangs in the ankle of a small child in Birmingham, he buried his fangs in the ankle of every American. The bell of man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man does not toll for any one man. It tolls for you, for me, for all of us.</p><h2>Hoosh: Roast Penguin, Scurvy Day, and Other Stories of Antarctic Cuisine (At Table)</h2><p><b>Winner of an Andre Simon Food and Drink Book Award - Special Commendation</b><br>Finalist for a ForeWord Book of the Year Award<br><br>Antarctica, the last place on Earth, is not famous for its cuisine. Yet it is famous for stories of heroic expeditions in which hunger was the one spice everyone carried. At the dawn of Antarctic cuisine, cooks improvised under inconceivable hardships, castaways ate seal blubber and penguin breasts while fantasizing about illustrious feasts, and men seeking the South Pole stretched their rations to the breaking point. Today, Antarctica's kitchens still wait for provisions at the far end of the planet's longest supply chain. Scientific research stations serve up cafeteria fare that often offers more sustenance than style. Jason C. Anthony, a veteran of eight seasons in the U.S. Antarctic Program, offers a rare workaday look at the importance of food in Antarctic history and culture.<br><br>Anthony's tour of Antarctic cuisine takes us from hoosh (a porridge of meat, fat, and melted snow, often thickened with crushed biscuit) and the scurvy-ridden expeditions of Shackleton and Scott through the twentieth century to his own preplanned three hundred meals (plus snacks) for a two-person camp in the Transantarctic Mountains. The stories in <i>Hoosh</i> are linked by the ingenuity, good humor, and indifference to gruel that make Anthony's tale as entertaining as it is enlightening.</p><p>"Historical writing, well presented, is supposed to be delicious, but in this brilliant, insightful book you will find many essential nutrients that tend to be missing from standard treatments of Antarctic exploration. This is a delightfully balanced reflection on human involvement in the Last Place on Earth, from earliest times to the modern day, presented with much gusto and the added sauce of firsthand experience." --Ross MacPhee, curator of the American Museum of Natural History and author of Race to The End: Amundsen, Scott, and the Attainment of the South Pole <br>"Some years ago a friend who worked on a nature program told me a tale of desperate penguin-killing (concluding with an ice pick) that left me with a fascination of how to feed yourself in the Antarctic.

A regular speaker at conferences nationwide, she is also the author of <i>Staying Well With Guided Imagery and Your Sixth Sense</i>.1 THE MANY FACES OF TRAUMA AND RECOVERY<br><br>A wide range of situations can catalyze post-traumatic stress, and there are many avenues-seemingly different, but very much related-to recovery. Here are some personal stories from trauma survivors that provide a sampling of traumatic situations, individual reactions, and roads to recovery.<br><br>A Child Who Nearly Drowns<br><br>A four-year-old boy, playing in his backyard, accidentally falls into the deep end of the pool, where he struggles briefly to reach the concrete lip but quickly sinks under the water. He winds up floating at the bottom of the pool. Thanks to some quick action from his seven-year-old sister and his frantic mother dialing 911, a nearby emergency rescue team is able to get to him in time to resuscitate him.<br><br>The little boy suffers no permanent physical damage, but he is showing signs of emotional distress in the days and weeks after the accident. Two weeks later he's afraid to fall asleep, and he suffers from persistent nightmares. He's back to wetting his bed and sucking his thumb by the third week. He's fearful most of the time, clinging to his mother and becoming distraught when she's out of sight. Getting him to stay in his preschool class is out of the question. Oddly, his symptoms seem to be getting worse instead of better.<br><br>A child psychologist comes to visit him and his mom at home and, with an impromptu arrangement of pillows and cushions on the floor, helps him reenact the accident. To the mother's surprise, her son is eager to play this game and enters into it enthusiastically. First the boy is running and jumping in the make-believe backyard, whooping and laughing. He is play-acting exactly what happened that afternoon. With a prompt from the therapist, he slips and falls into the "pool," landing headfirst into the soft cushions as the therapist holds him around his waist.<br><br>The therapist is now carefully watching the boy's movements and sees that his little feet are kicking ever so slightly, and his arms are flailing about. He asks the four-year-old how scared he is, and the boy says very, very scared. He struggles for a while longer and then becomes very still, lying facedown on the pillows. They do this several times, and as they do, with each succeeding reenactment, the event is getting less scary and more playful.<br><br>Next, the therapist encourages the boy to play-act the story with a different ending. The boy immediately goes back to the running and jumping and then falling into the pillows. This time the therapist comments on how he is kicking his feet and stroking his arms. Still holding him around the waist, he encourages him to kick harder and to swim more coherently, back toward the edge of the imaginary pool. The boy kicks and strokes more vigorously, and together they make it safely to the lip of the "pool," and to the waiting arms of Mom, who swoops him out with a cheer. The therapist, who has all along been functioning as the play-by-play announcer of this event, also cheers.<br><br>The boy loves the game, and they play it over and over, from start to finish. Each time the boy manages to kick and "swim" more effectively, displaying more and more mastery and confidence as he makes his way over to his mother. The cheers get louder.<br><br>That night he goes to bed without a whimper and sleeps a deep, untroubled sleep. Indeed, he shows no further evidence of emotional upset in the days and weeks that follow. His symptoms have been routed by the simple strategy of engaging his body and imagination to reenact the drowning, then replay it with a new ending-his own, forceful, effective kicks and strokes taking him to safety.<br><br>A Postcollision Trauma<br><br>Charlotte takes her turn pulling forward at a four-way stop sign, when, out of the corner of her right eye, she sees a shiny, dark metal mass speeding toward her. Instantly hyperalert and buzzing with adrenaline, she turns her head and watches with the attenuated perception of the terror-stricken, frozen in her seat, as a black minivan does its slow-motion roll toward her. She knows there's nothing she can do, and she is dead certain she will not survive the impact.<br><br>After what feels like a very long time of helpless waiting-actually only a few seconds in clock time-the van hits its mark with a loud, sickening crunch. The entire passenger side caves in, and the car is totaled, but Charlotte nonetheless shakily opens her door and wobbles out, unharmed. She is both spacey and wired, and she doesn't stop trembling for several hours.<br><br>That night she cannot sleep. She keeps seeing the rogue van, rolling inexorably toward her, as she sits frozen in her seat. And each time that image intrudes, her heart starts pounding, and she's again flushed with sweat and terror. For the next several weeks she's distracted and disconnected during the day, and sleepless and upset at night. Interrupting her, day and night, is this one flash of memory of the moment when she is helplessly watching the van rolling toward her.<br><br>At the suggestion of a friend, Charlotte goes to a counselor who is a specialist in this sort of thing. The counselor sits her down, hears the story of the accident, sees the flush of fear, the frozen posture, and notes all the symptoms. She asks good questions.<br><br>As a result of the conversation, the traumatized driver realizes that this van, coming out of the blue in the way that it did, took away her sense of everyday safety and predictability. She now understands that stop signs don't necessarily mean that people stop for them.<br><br>The counselor has Charlotte sit facing a horizontal bar of flashing lights and asks her to follow the lights with her eyes as they move back and forth, from right to left to right. She is able to do this easily enough. Then she asks her to recall the incident again, while following the lights, back and forth, with her eyes. She is able to do this. They repeat the exercise, this time with her voicing her feeling that nothing feels safe, that life is unpredictable and dangerous.<br><br>The therapist then asks her to remember the moment when she opened the car door and stepped out of the wreckage. She recalls that at that instant she was thinking with almost giddy wonder, Holy shit, I'm alive! It's a brief but miraculous feeling, carrying with it, she realizes, the optimistic implication that Somebody Up There must be looking out for her. Perhaps it's her dead father, or maybe it's a guardian angel, she says. She is asked to recall this moment of realization while following the moving lights, which she does. They repeat the exercise, this time with her voicing the assertion that she is protected by unseen forces.<br><br>Charlotte leaves that session feeling much better and is asymptomatic the subsequent week, but she returns a week later just to be sure. They repeat the entire sequence of the previous week, but instead of the light bar, this time the therapist gives her two odd little palm-sized implements that look like computer mouses to hold in her hands as she recalls the van rolling toward her and the moment of realizing she's still alive. They vibrate in her right hand, then her left, then her right, alternately buzzing her palms as she reimagines these two moments.<br><br>She leaves that second session with the memory of the collision perfectly intact, but it has no punch, no emotional charge. It doesn't jar her or upset her. Nor does it intrude on her, unbidden, later on. She just remembers the accident as something that happened to her. And she no longer assumes-and rightly so-that everyone stops for stop signs.<br><br>I have no idea how that happened-how watching some moving lights and having buzzers going off in my hands could result in extracting the terror from the memory of that experience. But that's what happened. Even after the first session with the lights, I was back to sleeping normally and concentrating and remembering decently. And a good thing, too, because I was getting pretty stupid at work-jumpy and irritable and making lots of mistakes-probably just from no sleep! I'm not sure how long that could have gone on. I suppose it would have dissipated on its own sooner or later, but it seemed to be getting worse, not better, and my work situation might have deteriorated pretty badly, I'm not sure. This was the second miracle. The first was my not getting killed; the second was not staying an emotional wreck!<br><br>A Life-Threatening Illness<br><br>A pediatrician is diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a virulent form of bone marrow cancer. He and his wife are disoriented and shaken but cope well with the shock of the diagnosis and the ensuing hardships of chemotherapy. They are a team and support each other during months of strenuous treatment, culminating in bone marrow transplantation. He comes very close to dying during the course of his treatment, but he slowly comes around and recovers. Nonetheless, he is in a weakened state for far longer than he ever expected. He hurts all over, and he still can't do many of the things he used to take for granted. He misses his patients, the challenge of his work, and the feeling of being useful and appreciated. He wonders if his life will ever get back to normal again.<br><br>All during his ordeal he remains patient, even-tempered, and considerate. With the help of his wife, he asks sensible, proactive questions, keeps up on the latest medical research, and studies his options carefully, every step of the way. His friends, colleagues, doctors, and nurses marvel at his attitude and forbearance.<br><br>His wife notices he is a little emotionally flat and out of it, but she assumes this is caused by fatigue from his physical condition, which is still compromised from the rigors of treatment. He is not sleeping well, and he has nightmares that take him to a very black and frightening place, from which he awakens short of breath, in sweat-soaked sheets. Every now and then he confesses to her that the slow recovery is discouraging. Something inside of him seems to have permanently changed, and he's not sure he even knows who he is anymore.<br><br>...</p><h2>Six Thinking Hats</h2><p>THE classic work about decision-making from the world-renowned writer and philosopher Edward de Bono Meetings are a crucial part of all our lives, but too often they go nowhere and waste valuable time.

The menus and recipes offered here include fruits, vegetables, proteins and various carbohydrates. Pounds reportedly come off quickly, safely and in large quantities in a six-phase regimen low in protein, cholesterol and sodium, and high in fiber. According to Moscovitz, more than 20,000 people have been treated by Walter Kempner, M.D., of Duke University since he developed the diet over 40 years ago, and many have kept the weight off. The bad news is that the rigid diet must be followed exactly, allows virtually no salt or spices, and prescribes a paltry calorie intake. The author hastransferred her fanaticism from food to the Rice Diet: "Mosco-Fats" was "a 275-pound ugly mound of flesh" who sold her worldly possessions for a stay at Kempner's clinic.

It was a small act of rebellion on her part, a note to self--and anyone else who cared--that she was not a willing participant in the farce that would unfold later that morning in second-period Health &amp; Family Life.On the way to homeroom, Ruth stopped by the library to deliver the grande nonfat latte she regularly picked up for Randall, the Reference Librarian, a fellow caffeine junkie who returned the favor by making the midday Starbucks run. The two of them had bonded several years earlier over their shared revulsion for what Randall charmingly called the "warmed-over Maxwell Piss" in the Teacher's Lounge, and their willingness to spend outlandish sums of money to avoid it.Randall kept his eyes glued to the computer screen as she approached. A stranger might have mistaken him for a dedicated Information Sciences professional getting an early start on some important research, but Ruth knew that he was actually scouring eBay for vintage Hasbro action figures, a task he performed several times a day. Randall's partner, Gregory, was a successful real-estate broker and part-time artistwho built elaborate dioramas featuring the French Resistance Fighter GI Joe, an increasingly hard-to-find doll whose moody Gallic good looks were dashingly accentuated by a black turtleneck sweater and beret. In his most recent work, Gregory had painstakingly re-created a Parisian caf� circa 1946, with a dozen identical GI Jeans staring soulfully at each other across red-checkered tablecloths, tiny handmade Gauloises glued to their plastic fingers."Thank God," he muttered, as Ruth placed the paper cup on his desk. "I was lapsing into a coma.""Any luck?""Just a few Russian infantrymen. Mint condition, my ass." Randall turned away from the screen and did a bug-eyed double take at the sight of Ruth's outfit. "I'm surprised your mother let you out of the house like that.""My new image." Ruth struck a pose, jutting out one hip and sucking in her cheeks like a model. "Like it?"He gave her a thorough top-to-bottom appraisal, taking full advantage of the gay man's license to stare."I do. Very Mary Kay Letourneau, if you don't mind my saying so.""My daughters said the same thing. Only they didn't mean it as a compliment."Randall reached for his coffee cup, raising it to his lips and blowing three times into the aperture on the plastic lid, as though it were some sort of wind instrument."They should be proud to have a mom who can carry off a skirt like that at ..." Randall's voice trailed off diplomatically." ... <i>at my age</i>?" Ruth inquired."You're not that old," Randall assured her. "And you look great.""Lotta good it does me."Randall sipped his latte and gave a philosophical shrug. He was a little older than Ruth, but you wouldn't have known it from his dark curly hair and eternally boyish face. Sometimes she felt sorry forhim--he was a cultured gay man, an opera-loving dandy with a fetish for Italian designer eyewear, trapped all day in a suburban high school--but Randall rarely complained about the life he'd made for himself in Stonewood Heights, even when he had good reason to."You never know when opportunity will knock," he reminded her. "And when it does, you don't want to answer the door in a ratty old bathrobe.""It better knock soon," Ruth said, "or it won't matter <i>what</i> I'm wearing."Randall set his cup down on the Wonder Woman coaster he kept on his desk, next to an autographed picture of Maria Callas. The serious expression on his face was only slightly compromised by his milk-foam mustache."So how are you feeling?" he asked. "You okay about all this?"Ruth shifted her gaze to the window behind the circulation desk, taking a moment to admire the autumnal image contained within its frame: a school bus parked beneath a blazing orange maple, a bright blue sky crowning the world. She felt a sudden urge to be far away, tramping through the woods or wandering around a strange city without a map."I just work here," she said. "I don't make the rules."&nbsp;<br>RUTH SPENT most of first period in the lounge, chatting with Donna DiNardo, a Biology teacher and field hockey coach in her late thirties. Over the summer, after years of being miserably single, Donna had met her soulmate--an overbearing optometrist named Bruce DeMastro--through an internet matchmaking service, and they'd gotten engaged after two magical dates.Ruth had been thrilled when she heard the news, partly because of the fairy-tale aspect of the story, and partly because she'd gotten tired of Donna's endless whining about how hard it was to meet a man once you'd reached a certain age, which had only served to make Ruth thatmuch more pessimistic about her own prospects. Oddly, though, finding love hadn't done much to improve Donna's mood; she was a worrier by nature, and the prospect of sharing her life with another person provided a mother lode of thorny new issues to fret about. Today, for example, she was wondering whether it would be a hardship for her students if, after the big day, she asked them to address her as Ms. DiNardo-DeMastro.Although Ruth felt strongly that women should keep their names when they married--she hadn't done so, and now she was stuck with her ex-husband's last name--she kept this opinion to herself, having learned the hard way that you could only lose by taking sides in matters as basic as this. She had once offended a pregnant friend by admitting--after persistent demands for her <i>honest opinion</i>--to disliking the name "Claudia," which, unbeknownst to her, the friend had already decided to bestow upon her firstborn child. Little Claudia was eight now, and Ruth still hadn't been completely forgiven."Do whatever you want," Ruth said. "The students won't care.""But DiNardo-DeMastro?" Donna was standing by the snack table, peering into a box of Dunkin' Munchkins with an expression of naked longing. She was a heavyset woman whose body image anxieties had reached a new level of obsession now that she'd been fitted for a wedding gown. "It's kind of a mouthful, isn't it?""You're fine either way," Ruth assured her."It's driving me crazy." Donna lifted a chocolate Munchkin from the box, pondered it for a moment, then put it back. "I really don't know what to do."With an air of melancholy determination, Donna backed away from the donut holes and helped herself to a styrofoam cup of vile coffee, into which she dumped two heaping spoonfuls of nondairy creamer and three packets of carcinogenic sweetener."Bruce hates hyphenated names," she continued. "He just wants me to be Donna DeMastro."Ruth glanced plaintively around the room, hoping for a little backup from her colleagues, but the two other teachers present--Pete Fontana (Industrial Arts) and Sylvia DeLacruz (Spanish)--were ostentatiously immersed in their reading, none too eager to embroil themselves in the newest installment of Donna's prenuptial tribulations. Ruth didn't blame them; she would've done the same if not for her guilty conscience. Donna had been a kind and supportive friend last spring, when Ruth was the one with the problem, and Ruth still felt like she owed her."I'm sure you'll work something out," she said."If my name was Susan it wouldn't be such a big deal," Donna pointed out, drifting back toward the Munchkins as if drawn by an invisible force. "But Donna DiNardo-DeMastro? That's too many <i>D</i>'s.""Alliteration," agreed Ruth. "I'm a fellow sufferer.""I don't want to turn into a joke," Donna said, with surprising vehemence. "It's hard enough to be a woman teaching science."Ruth sympathized with her on this particular point. Jim Wallenski, the man Donna had replaced, had been known as "Mr. Wizard" to three decades' worth of Stonewood Heights students. He was a gray-haired, elfin man who wandered the halls in a lab coat and bow tie, smiling enigmatically as he tugged on his right earlobe, the Science Geek from central casting. Despite her master's degree in Molecular Biology, Donna just didn't look the part in her tailored bell-bottom pantsuits and tasteful gold jewelry. She was too earthbound, too well organized, too attentive to other people, more credible as a highly efficient office manager than as Ms. Wizard."I don't know, Ruth." Donna peered into the Munchkins box. "I'm just feeling overwhelmed by all these decisions.""Eat it," said Ruth."What?" Donna seemed startled. "What did you say?""Go ahead. One Munchkin's not gonna kill you."Donna looked scandalized. "You know I'm trying to be good.""Treat yourself." Ruth stood up from the couch. "I gotta look over some notes. I'll catch up with you later, okay?"After a very brief hesitation, Donna plucked a powdered Munchkin out of the box and popped it into her mouth, smiling at Ruth as she did so, as if the two of them were partners in crime. Ruth gave a little wave as she slipped out the door. Donna waved back, chewing slowly, her fingertips and lips dusted with sugar.&nbsp;<br>THE SUPERINTENDENT and the Virginity Consultant were waiting outside Room 23, both of them smiling as if they were happy to see Ruth come clackety-clacking down the long brown corridor, as if the three of them were old friends who made it a point to get together whenever possible."Well, well," said Dr. Farmer, in the jaunty tone he only trotted out for awkward situations. "If it isn't the estimable Ms. Ramsey. Right on time."Glancing at Ruth's outfit with badly concealed disapproval, he thrust out his damp, meaty paw. She shook it, disconcerted as always by the change that came over the Superintendent when she found herself face-to-face with him. From a distance he looked like himself--the handsome, vigorous, middle-aged man Ruth had met fifteen years earlier--but up close he morphed into a bewildered senior citizen with rheumy eyes, liver spots, and unruly tufts of salt-and-pepper ear hair."Punctuality is one of my many virtues," Ruth said. "Even my ex-husband would agree."Ruth's former husband--the father of her two children--had taught for a few years in Stonewood Heights before taking a job in nearby Gifford Township. He'd recently been promoted to Curriculum Supervisor for seventh- and eighth-grade Social Studies, and was rumored to be next in line for an Assistant Principalship at the middle school."Frank's a good man." The Superintendent spoke gravely, as if defending Frank's honor. "Very dependable.""Unless you're married to him," Ruth said, doing her best to make this sound like a lighthearted quip."How long were you together?" asked the consultant, JoAnn Marlow, addressing Ruth in that disarmingly cordial way she had, as if the two of them were colleagues and not each other's worst nightmare."Eleven years." Ruth shook her head, the way she always did when contemplating the folly of her marriage. "I don't know <i>what</i> I was thinking."JoAnn laid a cool, consoling hand on Ruth's arm. As usual, she was done up like a contestant in a beauty pageant--elaborate hairdo, gobs of makeup, everything but the one-piece swimsuit and the sash that said "Miss Morality"--though Ruth didn't understand why she bothered. If you were determined to live like a nun--and determined to broadcast this fact to the world--why waste all that time making yourself pretty?"Must be so awful," JoAnn whispered, as if Ruth had just lost a close relative under tragic circumstances."Felt like a ton of bricks off my chest, if you want the truth. And Frank and I actually get along much better now that we don't have to see each other every day.""I meant for the children," JoAnn explained. "It's always so hard on the children.""The girls are fine," Ruth told her, resisting the urge to add, <i>not that it's any of</i> your <i>business.</i>"Cute kids," said Dr. Farmer. "I remember when the oldest was just a baby.""She's fourteen now," said Ruth. "Just as tall as I am.""This is where the fun starts." He shook his head, speaking from experience. His middle child, Andrea, had been wild, a teenage runawayand drug addict who'd been in and out of rehab numerous times before finally straightening out. "The boys start calling, you have to worry about where they are, who they're with, what time they're coming home--"The bell rang, signaling the end of first period. Within seconds, the hallways were filled with platoons of sleepy-looking teenagers, nodding and muttering to one another as they passed. Some of them looked like little kids, Ruth thought, others like grown-ups, sixteen-and seventeen-year-old adults. According to surveys, at least a third of them were having sex, though Ruth knew all too well that you couldn't always guess which ones just from looking at them."Girls have to protect themselves," JoAnn said. "They're living in a dangerous world.""Eliza took two years of karate," Ruth reported. "She made it up to her green belt. Or maybe orange, I can't remember. But Maggie, my younger one, she's the jock. She's going to test for her blue belt next month. She does soccer and swimming, too.""Impressive," noted Dr. Farmer. "My wife just started taking Tai Chi. She does it with some Chinese ladies in the park, first thing in the morning. But that's not really a martial art. It's more of a movement thing."The adults vacated the doorway, making way for the students who began drifting into the classroom. Several of them smiled at Ruth, and a few said hello. She'd felt okay right up to that point, more or less at peace with the decision she'd made. But now, quite suddenly, she became aware of the cold sweat pooling in her armpits, the queasy feeling spreading out from her belly."I was talking about spiritual self-defense," said JoAnn. "We're living in a toxic culture. The messages these girls get from the media are just so relentlessly degrading. No wonder they hate themselves."Dr. Farmer nodded distractedly as he scanned the nearly empty hallway. His face relaxed as Principal Venuti rounded the corner bythe gym and began moving toward them at high speed, hunched in his usual bowlegged wrestler's crouch, as if he were looking for someone to take down."Here's our fourth," said Dr. Farmer. "So we're good to go.""Looks like it," agreed Ruth. "Be a relief just to get it over with.""Oh, come <i>on,</i>" JoAnn said, smiling at Ruth to conceal her annoyance. "It's not gonna be <i>that</i> bad.""Not for you," Ruth said, smiling right back at her. "It's gonna be just great for you."&nbsp;<br><i>SOME PEOPLE enjoy it.</i>That was all Ruth had said. Even now, when she'd had months to come to terms with the fallout from this remark, she still marveled at the power of those four words, which she'd uttered without premeditation and without any sense of treading on forbidden ground.The incident had occurred the previous spring, during a cont...</p><h2>The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book</h2><p>From the breast health experts at Mayo Clinic comes a guide to the many aspects of breast cancer&#x2014;from prevention, to care and coping, to survival, to living with hope.<br><br><i>The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book</i> is the trusted resource for anyone wanting reliable information about this dreaded disease.

Here are facts about the disease, but also suggestions and inspiration for working effectively with one's doctors and caregivers. This volume offers solid tools for coping with the many uncertainties and decisions that need to be made when one is diagnosed.</p><p>Mayo Clinic is the first and largest integrated, not-for-profit group practice in the world. Doctors from every medical specialty work together to care for patients, joined by common systems and a philosophy that the needs of the patient come first. Over 3,600 physicians and scientists and 50,000 allied staff work at Mayo, which has sites in Rochester, Minn.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Scottsdale/Phoenix, Ariz. Collectively, Mayo Clinic treats more than 500,000 patients a year. For more than 100 years, millions of people from all walks of life have found answers at Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic works with many insurance companies, does not require a physician referral in most cases and is an in-network provider for millions of people.This comprehensive guide to breast cancer should be on every woman&#x2019;s must-read list. Mayo Clinic doctors Hartmann and Loprinzi draw on the know-how of their colleagues to spell out what causes cancer, what steps people can take to prevent it, and why everyone should care. Each year, they explain, doctors diagnose cancer in more than 1.5 million Americans, including more than 200,000 with breast cancer. In colorful language, they describe cancer cells as biological anarchists that stop following the rules. The authors don&#x2019;t make patients feel guilty, but they do note that 50 to 75 percent of U.S. cancers arise from lifestyle factors, such as being obese and drinking too much alcohol. The good news is that preventive measures and early detection and treatment mean that today the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with breast cancer is nearly 90 percent. With an index, many useful resources, and a helpful glossary (who would know that a punch biopsy is the use of a hole-punch-type instrument to remove a sample of skin tissue?), this is a valuable resource that belongs in every library. --Karen Springen</p><h2>Magic symbols of the world</h2><p>First edition hardcover published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group.

And Gordon, who had forgotten them for seven years and, when he remembered, came back with fat Debbie, who shared her one brain cell with a poodle. And then there were Charles and Isobel, the children. Charles, the acne-scarred Lost Boy, passed his life awaiting visits from aliens and the return of his mother. But it is Isobel to whom the story belongs--Isobel, born on the Streets of Trees, who drops into pockets of time and out again. Isobel is sixteen and she too is waiting for the return of her mother--the thin, dangerous Eliza with her scent of nicotine, Arpege and sex, whose disappearance is part of the mystery that still remains at the heart of the forest.</p><p>Human Croquet is a game in which some people act as hoops while others propel a blindfolded "ball" around the course. Though the game is never actually played in Kate Atkinson's remarkable novel, <i>Human Croquet</i>, the parallels between plot and pastime are undeniable. Atkinson, winner of the 1995 Whitbread Award in Britain, tells the story of Isobel Fairfax and her older brother, Charles. The children's parents vanished when they were young, leaving them to the care of their grandmother, now dead, and their Aunt Vinny. Recently their father has returned with "the Debbie-wife" in tow, and they all live in Arden, the family's ancestral home built on the foundations of the original manor house that burned to the ground in 1605. According to family legend, the first Fairfax took a wife who mysteriously disappeared one day, leaving in her wake a curse on the Fairfax name. More than 300 years later, Fairfax descendants are still struggling with this painful legacy. <p>Atkinson's novel is obviously not rooted in dull reality. Narrator Isobel has an uncanny knowledge of past and future events; Charles is obsessed with the concept of parallel universes and time travel; and a faery curse hangs over everybody. Fortunately, Kate Atkinson is a masterful writer who manages to keep her world of wonders in check. <i>Human Croquet</i> is no ordinary novel, and readers who venture into the Fairfax universe are in for a magical ride.</p>"Wonderfully eloquent and forceful Kate Atkinson goes at the same pace in her second novel as she did in her first...welcome back, wild north-easter...brilliant and engrossing"<br>-Penelope Fitzgerald, <i>Evening Standart</i><p>"Huge, exhilarating, loving and detailed eruption of a novel...an utterly intoxicating display of novelistic elan...big and joyous, literary and accessible...storytelling at it buoyant best"<br>-<i>The Scotsman</i></p><p>"Vivid, richly imaginative, hilarious and frightening by turns"<br>-Cressida Connolly, <i>Observer</i></p></p><h2>The Mind and the Way: Buddhist Reflections on Life</h2><p>What would life be like if each one of us chose compassion over anger, loving-kindness over hatred, awareness over ignorance? <i>The Mind and the Way</i> demonstrates a radically simple approach to life, one in which we are able to awaken to our true loving nature and delight in the mystery and wonder of the world. With warmth and a wonderful sense of humor, Ajahn Sumedho draws on the experiences of ordinary life to convey Buddhist insights that for 2,500 years have continued to remain vital and pertinent to our lives.</p><p>For nearly fifty years Ajahn Sumedho has embodied the Buddha&#39;s way. As a young man he completed an M.A. at the University of California at Berkeley, was a medic in the Navy, and taught in the Peace Corps in Borneo. For twelve years, beginning in 1966, he studied closely with the renowned meditation master Ajahn Chah, who appointed him to be the first Western abbot of a Thai monastery. Now based in England, he is the spiritual head of a global community of monks and nuns.Sumedho, an American Thervadin monk trained in Thailand, presents Buddhism as a way rather than a religion. A graduate of the University of California-Berkeley, a Navy fighter pilot, and a Peace Corps volunteer, the author spent ten years as a contemplative forest monk before establishing the first forest monastery in England. Compiled from talks, his book deals with the nature of suffering and release from it by living a virtuous life awakening the mind to the impermanence of all things. Sumedho uses traditional insight meditation practices to open the heart and mind to the path of truth; he promotes a life of nonattachment, yet enriched with loving kindness, a simple life of nonexcess, profound goodness, cooperation rather than competition, and the mind that transcends but does not abandon the world. The keyword is balance. With its humorous observations upon his early days in Thailand, Sumedho's work is acutely practical and easy to read.

They reveal the unique place of human desire, love, and ecstasy, where there exists not just the union of two souls, but the crux of the universe.<br><br>Here is a new kind of love lyric for our time-one of longing, connection, and wholeness.</p><p>Called 'Jelaluddin Balkhi' by the Persians and Afghans, Rumi was born on September 30, 1207, in Balkh, Afghanistan, then a part of the Persian Empire. Between 1215 and 1220, he and his family fled the threat of the invading Mongols and emigrated to Konya, Turkey; it was sometime after this that he became known as 'Rumi' meaning 'from Roman Anatolia'. His father, Bahauddin Walad, was a theologian and a mystic, and after his death Rumi took over the role of sheikh in the dervish learning community in Konya. Rumi pursued the life of an orthodox religious scholar until 1244 when he encountered the wandering dervish, Shams of Tabriz. After an exchange of religious ideas Shams and Rumi became inseparable friends, transported into a world of pure, mystical, conversation. This intense relationship left Rumi's students feeling neglected, and, feeling the ill-will, Shams disappeared. After news of Shams came from Damascus, Rumi's son was sent to bring him back, and the mystical conversation, or sohbet, began again. After Shams' second disappearance (he was probably murdered), and a period spent searching for his lost friend, Rumi came to the conclusion that Shams was now a part of him. Further concluding that when he wrote poetry it was Shams writing through him, he called his huge collection of odes and quatrains The Works of Shams of Tabriz. Following Shams' death Rumi had two other mystical companions, firstly Saladin Zarkub, a goldsmith, and then, after Saladin's death, Husam Chelebi, Rumi's scribe and student. It was Husam that Rumi declared the source of his vast six-volume masterwork <i>Mathnawi</i>. After twelve years of work on this masterpiece Rumi died on December 17, 1273.<br>Colemam Barks taught poetry and creative writing at the University of Georgia for thirty years and has been a student of Sufism since 1977.

The Middle Passage focuses attention on the torturous journey which brought slaves from Africa to the Americas, allowing readers to bear witness to the sufferings of an entire people.</p><p>The Middle Passage is the name given to one of the most tragic ordeals in history: the cruel and terrifying journey of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean. In this seminal work, master artist Tom Feelings tells the complete story of this horrific diaspora in sixty-four extraordinary narrative paintings. Achingly real, they draw us into the lives of the millions of African men, women, and children who were savagely torn from their beautiful homelands, crowded into disease-ridden &#34;death ships&#34;, and transported under nightmarish conditions to the so-called New World. An introduction by noted historian Dr. John Henrik Clarke traces the roots of the Atlantic slave trade and gives a vivid summary of its four centuries of brutality. The Middle Passage reaches us on a visceral level. No one can experience it and remain unmoved. But while we absorb the horror of these images, we also can find some hope in them. They are a tribute to the survival of the human spirit, and the humanity won by the survivors of the Middle Passage belongs to us all.<i>"When I am asked what kind of work I do, my answer is that I am astoryteller in picture form, who tries to reflect and interpret thelives and experiences of the people who gave me life. When I am askedwho I am, I say I am an African who was born in America. Both answersconnect me specifically with my past and present...therefore I bring tomy art a quality which is rooted in the culture of Africa...and expandedby the experience of being black in America. I use the vehicle of 'fineart' and 'illustration' as a viable expression of form, yet strivingalways to do this from an African perspective, an African world view,and above all to tell the African story; this is my content. Thestruggle to create artwork, as well as to live creatively under anyconditions and survive (like my ancestors), embodies my particularheritage in America."<br><br></i>Born in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, NewYork, Tom Feelings attended the George Westinghouse Vocational HighSchool where he majored in Art.

While its basic chemistry remains largely the same, wine's social roles have changed fundamentally, being invented and reinvented many times over many centuries. <p>In <em>Inventing Wine</em>, Paul Lukacs tells the enticing story of wine's transformation from a source of spiritual and bodily nourishment to a foodstuff valued for the wide array of pleasures it can provide. He chronicles how the prototypes of contemporary wines first emerged when people began to have options of what to drink, and he demonstrates that people selected wine for dramatically different reasons than those expressed when doing so was a necessity rather than a choice.</p><p>During wine's long history, men and women imbued wine with different cultural meanings and invented different cultural roles for it to play. The power of such invention belonged both to those drinking wine and to those producing it. These included tastemakers like the medieval Cistercian monks of Burgundy who first thought of place as an important aspect of wine's identity; nineteenth-century writers such as Grimod de la Reyniere and Cyrus Redding who strived to give wine a rarefied aesthetic status; scientists like Louis Pasteur and �mile Peynaud who worked to help winemakers take more control over their craft; and a host of visionary vintners who aimed to produce better, more distinctive-tasting wines, eventually bringing high-quality wine to consumers around the globe.</p><p>By charting the changes in both wine's appreciation and its production, Lukacs offers a fascinating new way to look at the present as well as the past.</p></p><p>Paul Lukacs is the author of American Vintage and The Great Wines of America. A James Beard, Cliquot, and IACP award winner, he has been writing about wine and its cultural contexts for nearly twenty years. He is a professor of English at Loyola University of Maryland, where he directs the University&#39;s Center for the Humanities. He lives in Baltimore.&#x201c;Rather than an eternal cultural verity, wine is the product of innovative discontinuities, according to this flavorful history....

Themes of interest to oenophiles, from wine&#x2019;s longtime disrepute in North America to England&#x2019;s love affair with Bordeaux, and fascinating details&#x2015;for instance, the unearthing of 26 casks of wine in King Tut&#x2019;s tomb&#x2015;heighten the pleasure of this engrossing narrative. A richly readable and authoritative addition to the literature of wine.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In highly readable prose, Lukacs tells the story of winemaking&#x2019;s worldwide history, recounting such ever-fascinating stories as the discovery of champagne and the creation of phenomenally unctuous and costly wines from what appear to be overripe, rotten grapes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Just when it seemed that there was nothing new to be said about wine, Paul Lukacs tells an intriguing and original tale that is thoroughly enjoyable reading.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Kurlansky, author of <em>Birdseye: The Adventures of a Curious Man</em> and <em>Salt: A World History</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Inventing Wine</em> makes us grateful as wine lovers that we are living in the second golden age of wine, when the quality and choices far exceed anything possible before.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Jameson, <em>New York Journal of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Paul Lukacs&#x2019;s <em>Inventing Wine</em> focuses on how the perception of wine has changed over time, through wars, revolution, prosperity and deprivation. ... <em>Inventing Win</em>e is broader and more ambitious in scope than his previous books, looking at how wine and Western civilization grew up together.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dave McIntyre, <em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>Breaking News (Godmothers, Book 5) (The Godmothers)</h2><p><b>Life Is Full Of Surprises</b><br><br>Teresa "Toots" Amelia Loudenberry has her quirks, but no one--especially not her trusted friends Sophia, Ida, and Mavis--would ever question her loyalty.

The Australian outback is a bone-dry wilderness to those unaccustomed to its relentless hardship. Luke Bowman would have died there when his crooked partner left him wounded had it not been for the ministrations of an English girl brought up among Aborigines. In gratitude, he takes her to his farm near Perth, where his invalid wife, Rosemary, welcomes the red-haired half-savage, whom they christen Meg. Unbeknownst to all but an implacable, greedy enemy, she is the heiress to a fortune. When an attempt on her life is followed by Rosemary's death and Luke's heartbroken defection, Meg is deposited at a stuffy Swiss finishing school. Yet danger threatens even there, and in the company of several appealing companions she embarks on a pilgrimage through the polite drawing rooms of Victorian England, across the decks of a well-appointed yacht and along an unbeaten desert trail, in search of safe harbor. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.This slow-moving, often stilted account follows "Mitji," a white child raised by aborigines in the Australian outback, in her attempts to discover her "true people." Leaving the tribe, the girl rescues a homesteader and is in turn taken in by the man and his ailing wife. The rest of the tale deals with Meg, as she is now called, discovering her real identity, the efforts of the villain of the piece to eliminate her, her heroic rescue of a shipwrecked party, and the ultimate happy ending. Since Meg's identification and future are virtually assured in chapter 6, only the determined reader may want to see things through to the predicted resolution. Judith A. Gifford, Salve Regina Coll.

Three aspiring concert pianists - Wertheimer, Glenn Gould, and the narrator - have dedicated their lives to achieving the status of a virtuoso. But one day, two of them overhear Gould playing Bach&#39;s Goldberg Variations, and his incomparable genius instantly destroys them both. They are forced to abandon their musical ambitions: Wertheimer, over a tortured process of disintegration that sees him becoming obsessed with both writing and his own sister, with whom he has a quasi-incestuous relationship culminating in death; and the narrator, instantly, retreating into obscurity to write a book that he periodically destroys and restarts. Written as a monologue in one remarkable unbroken paragraph, Thomas Bernhard&#39;s dazzling meditation on failure, genius, and fame is a radical new reading experience: musical, paralysing, raging, and inimitable.</p><p></p><h2>The Threads &amp; Crafts book of Ribbon Embroidery and Stumpwork (Threads &amp; Crafts)</h2><p>This book is a must for all lovers of ribbon embroidery and stumpwork.

Original.</p><p>Hazel Holt is the author of seven previous Mrs. Malory novels. She was a personal friend and literary advisor to Barbara Pym, and the author of Pym?s official biography. A former television critic and feature writer, she lives in Somerset, England.Sheila Malory, amateur sleuth, novelist and critic, is happiest writing in her home outside London and spending time with her family. On one of her occasional trips to the capital, she sees her old college friend Beth, a bestselling author, along with several of their acquaintances. Soon after, Beth is found dead, apparently of an accidental drug overdose. Mrs. Malory is named literary executor of Beth's work, and she embarks on the task of reviewing her friend's unpublished manuscripts and speaking with the widower and children, not an enjoyable undertaking as both Beth and her husband were involved in love affairs and estranged from their children. For a time, Mrs. Malory assumes that she'll be able to put Beth's papers in order and perhaps write a biography of her friend, but these plans end when a researcher working on a critique of Beth's work is murdered. Now it's up to the heroine to find out if the two deaths are related and sort out the sordid details of Beth's life and demise. Mrs. Malory's demure manner belies a skilled detective who's clever, witty and most entertaining; Holt's (Death of a Dean) latest is a fine addition to the charming series.

How can you hope to pick out the best of anything, let alone from such a contentious category as SF (and military SF, at that)? But this 13-story collection really <i>does</i> pull together at least <i>some</i> of the best short stories penned for the genre in the last century. Thanks to editors Harry Turtledove and Martin H. Greenberg, you'll find some of science fiction's biggest names--and most influential shorts--in this expertly chosen anthology.<p> Chronologically, the entries range from '50s pieces like Philip K. Dick's "Second Variety" and Arthur C. Clarke's "Superiority" to more modern ruminations on war like "The Scapegoat" by C.J. Cherryh and "To the Storming Gulf" by Gregory Benford. But rather than quality (all these stories are of inarguable pedigree) or even breadth, what might recommend these most to readers new to them are the ideas and other works they later inspired: Anne McCaffrey's "Dragonrider" and Orson Scott Card's "Ender's Game" both gave rise to phenomenally successful series, Joe W. Haldeman's "Hero" preceded <i>The Forever War</i>, and Philip K. Dick's "Second Variety" became the SF thriller <i>Screamers</i>. The collection also gives you a glimpse of what dark thoughts were rattling around the heads of prolific writers like David Drake and George R.R. Martin in the '70s. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Harry Turtledove</b> is the award-winning author of the alternate-history works <i>The Man with the Iron Heart, The Guns of the South, </i>and <i>How Few Remain</i> (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel); the Hot War books: <i>Bombs Away, Fallout, </i>and<i> Armistice;</i> the War That Came Early novels: <i>Hitler&#x2019;s War, West and East, The Big Switch,</i> <i>Coup d&#x2019;Etat, Two Fronts, </i>and<i> Last Orders; </i>the Worldwar saga: <i>In the Balance, Tilting the Balance, Upsetting the Balance,</i> and<i> Striking the Balance;</i> the Colonization books: <i>Second Contact, Down to Earth,</i> and<i> Aftershocks; </i>the Great War epics: <i>American Front, Walk in Hell,</i> and <i>Breakthroughs;</i> the American Empire novels: <i>Blood and Iron, The Center Cannot Hold, </i>and <i>Victorious Opposition;</i> and the Settling Accounts series: <i>Return Engagement, Drive to the East, The Grapple, </i>and<i> In at the Death</i>.

Gladwell, the best-selling author of &#34;The Tipping Point&#34;, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of &#34;thin slices&#34; of behavior. The key is to rely on our &#34;adaptive unconscious&#34;--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea.Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us &#34;mind blind,&#34; focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to &#34;the Warren Harding Effect&#34; (i.e., voting for a handsome buthapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the &#34;dark side of blink,&#34; he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell&#39;s ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. --Barbara Mackoff</p><p></p><h2>Carmine: A Little More Red (New York Times Best Illustrated Books)</h2><p>And, as Carmine takes off on her bicycle with Rufus, that is just what she intends to do.

Unlike the teen titles on the market that focus on dating and romance, this book addresses a girl&#39;s very first forays into the &#34;boy/girl world&#34; and gives her wise, warm advice. Help! letters from girls--collected from our AmericanGirl magazine files--and quizzes are included, too.</p><p>Gr 5-8-This upbeat title travels familiar ground, dispensing good advice to girls who are experiencing the first twinges of romance. The book is organized into five main sections: "Brave New World," covering crushes; "Who Likes Who" or how to let a boy know you are interested; "Life in the Fishbowl" on balancing friends and boyfriends; and "Going Together," which offers some ideas for hanging out and advice on the first kiss. The final topic, "Taking Care of You," features a quiz aimed at evaluating how girls are handling themselves in the arena of life with boys. The lively text is interspersed with quick tests and letters from girls. The overall theme, that of developing self-confidence, comes through loud and clear. The comic-book graphics, friendly fonts, and use of color will be appreciated by teens.

This book offers helpful advice to girls who are suddenly seeing boys as something other than an annoyance. Topics range from balancing friends and boyfriends, and chaste but fun suggestions for what to do when "going out" to surviving the inevitable rejection. The focus is on social, not sexual, aspects of those first opposite-sex relationships (these youngsters have just about gotten around to first kisses). The book is sprinkled with "letters" purported to be by real kids, but no acknowledgments are included. There are also several quizzes of the teen-magazine, pop-psychology variety. Cartoon illustrations (some with hard-to-read hand-printed dialogue bubbles) will either amuse or annoy. Although youngsters spend a sadly brief time at the training-wheels stage in their relationships, it's a confusing period; the advice offered in this book is conservative, age-appropriate, and reassuring. <i>Catherine Andronik</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The only American reporter in the official press party, Larry Kane obtained exclusive, revealing interviews with John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Fortunately, Kane saved his original notes and tapes, and shares them here for the first time. That material provides the basis for his intimate look back at the phenomenon of the Fab Four, and insights into the humor and personality of each group member. <i>Ticket to Ride</i>, illustrated with more than 30 photographs, captures a rare time in history, gracefully melding the story of the Beatles revolution with the changing tenor of the country. Hear John Lennon's early public criticism of the Vietnam War, and learn about the night the Beatles met Bob Dylan. "We had a crazy party the night we met [Dylan]," Paul recounts. I thought I got the meaning to life that night. <i>Ticket to Ride</i> includes a 60minute audio CD featuring rare interviews.</p><p><b>Larry Kane</b> is the dean of Philadelphia television news anchors,&#x201d; having had a 45-year career covering domestic and world events. He previously wrote an account of his tour experiences with the Beatles in his book <i>Ticket to Ride</i>. Kane lives in southeastern Pennsylvania.For a 21-year-old journalist in 1964, a chance to follow the Beatles on their ground-breaking first American tour was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Larry Kane was that journalist, and TICKET TO RIDE is his fascinating memoir of that tour, and the subsequent one in 1965. Read with an air of bemusement that befits Kane&#39;s current reputation as Philadelphia&#39;s most well-known TV news anchor, the book, while hardly a gossip-fest, nevertheless contains many titillating behind-the-scenes anecdotes that only somebody privy to the backstage antics of the Fab Four could report. Kane tells of a much more innocent time when the whole notion of rock-star decadence was in its infancy, not to mention the commercial aspects that were coming into being, mostly due to the Beatles&#39; innovations.

For them, America proved to be both a strange and opportune destination. A "foreign homeland" (Thomas Mann), it would frustrate and confuse, yet afford a clarity of understanding unencumbered by native habit and bias. However inadvertently, the condition of cultural exile would promote acute inquiries into the American experience. What impact did these famous newcomers have on American culture, and how did America affect them? </p><p>George Balanchine, in collaboration with Stravinsky, famously created an Americanized version of Russian classical ballet. Kurt Weill, schooled in Berlin jazz, composed a Broadway opera. Rouben Mamoulian's revolutionary Broadway productions of <em>Porgy and Bess</em> and <em>Oklahoma!</em> drew upon Russian "total theater." An army of German filmmakers&#x2014;among them F. W. Murnau, Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch, and Billy Wilder&#x2014;made Hollywood more edgy and cosmopolitan. Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich redefined film sexuality. Erich Korngold upholstered the sound of the movies. Rudolf Serkin inspirationally inculcated dour Germanic canons of musical interpretation. An obscure British organist reinvented himself as "Leopold Stokowski." However, most of these gifted �migr�s to the New World found that the freedoms they enjoyed in America diluted rather than amplified their high creative ambitions.</p><p>A central theme of Joseph Horowitz's study is that Russians uprooted from St. Petersburg became "Americans"&#x2014;they adapted. Representatives of Germanic culture, by comparison, preached a German cultural bible&#x2014;they colonized. "The polar extremes," he writes, "were Balanchine, who shed Petipa to invent a New World template for ballet, and the conductor George Szell, who treated his American players as New World Calibans to be taught Mozart and Beethoven." A symbiotic relationship to African American culture is another ongoing motif emerging from Horowitz's survey: the immigrants "bonded with blacks from a shared experience of marginality"; they proved immune to "the growing pains of a young high culture separating from parents and former slaves alike." </p></p><p><p>Joseph Horowitz is the author of seven previous books, including <em>Understanding Toscanini</em> (named one of the best books of the year by the New York Book Critics Circle and <em>Publishers Weekly</em>) and <em>Classical Music in America</em> (named one of the best books of the year by the <em>Economist</em>). A former <em>New York Times</em> music critic and executive director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, he is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and two NEH Fellowships, among other honors. He lives in New York City.</p>Horowitz's sophisticated case studies explore a tension in the art of 20th-century performers who emigrated from Europe or Russia: they both stayed foreign and became American. A one-time executive director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, Horowitz (<i>Classical Music in America</i>) extends his domain beyond music into other performing arts, examining key exemplars in each discipline such as Igor Stravinsky in music composition, George Balanchine in ballet, and Marlene Dietrich and Josef von Sternberg in Hollywood. His understanding of the political nuances of immigrants' artistic work, influenced by the circumstances in which they fled their native countries, is fascinating. Yet Horowitz emphasizes the Americanization of the artworks at the expense of their European roots. Based on what Horowitz admits is a highly select group of artists, he often poses broad questions and makes bold, generalized statements, such as trivializing the plight of the immigrant artist in contemporary American society: the tensions of forced migration&#x2014;of exile and nostalgia&#x2014;have abated. Still, what Horowitz lacks in balance he more than makes up for in emotion, and in expounding on the political resonance of the immigrants' art, he composes an enlightening, informative read. 31 b&amp;w photos. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Poor Mr. Popper isn't exactly unhappy; he just wishes he had seen something of the world before meeting Mrs. Popper and settling down. Most of all, he wishes he had seen the Poles, and spends his spare time between house-painting jobs reading all about polar explorations. Admiral Drake, in response to Mr. Popper's fan letter, sends him a penguin; life at 432 Proudfoot Avenue is never the same again. From one penguin living in the icebox, the Popper family grows to include 12 penguins, all of whom must be fed. Thus is born "Popper's Performing Penguins, First Time on Any Stage, Direct from the South Pole."

The beginning may be predictably crappy, slow, and discombobulated until a rhythm develops and momentum builds leaving you stricken with that familiar glimmer of hope. When it comes to the final stretch, everyone accepts that there may be failure, there may be disappointment, but the struggle is always gritty and memorable, and occasionally, if you are really lucky, something magical will happen.<br><br>My beginning came half an hour earlier with a phone call reeling me in from a cozy dreamless void.<br><br>"Hello," I said, two disjointed syllables caught in a sticky web at the back of my throat.<br><br>"This is Dr. Keene, one of the new surgical residents. We haven't met but I've got a dog, a ten-year-old spayed female German shepherd; she's bloated and . . . like . . . well . . . I need you to come in for the surgery. Sorry."<br><br>All I heard was sound, not words I could interpret, my brain dormant on my pillow.<br><br>"Hello, are you still there?"<br><br>"Yeah, sure, I'm listening," I croaked, wiping a palm across my face. "What time is it?"<br><br>She told me and dove into her apology.<br><br>"I really hate to disturb you but, like, my backup's not answering his pager and, like, I didn't know what else to do." Her words surfed through me--a Valley Girl inflection--and sluggish gray matter dug out a memory of a recent departmental memo--"Be sure to welcome our first-year surgery resident, Dr. Sarah Keene, from the University of California, Davis."<br><br>I came awake, sat up in bed, and told my wife to go back to sleep.<br><br>"No problem, Dr. Keene. Tell me about your GDV."<br><br>As a new surgery resident, Dr. Keene may know all about GDV, an acronym that stands for gastric dilatation and volvulus, commonly referred to, with a satisfying rustic flavor, as "bloat." But more than likely, at this stage in her training, her understanding is primarily academic, words and phrases in a textbook, disease as bullets of information in shocking fluorescent pink highlights. She will be a year out from veterinary school, a year in which she will probably have diagnosed and managed several cases of GDV. She knows all about this bizarre anatomical aberration and the inevitable, rampant pathology it will incite. She even knows exactly what needs to be done. But, until now, until tonight, she has never been the one who actually picks up a scalpel and makes the cure happen. Tonight, for the first time in her professional career, she is the surgeon on call, and not surprisingly, she is in need of some help.<br>GDV is a true veterinary surgical emergency. It typically occurs in deep-chested dogs like German shepherds, Great Danes, and standard poodles but, on occasion, I've even seen it in breeds as small as dachshunds. No one is entirely sure why it happens, but oftentimes the animal eats a large meal, gets some exercise, and an hour or so later the problems begin. Fermented gas starts to accumulate in the distended stomach, and for whatever reason the entire organ twists around and flips over on its long axis. The effect is catastrophic. The twist blocks off the esophagus so despite the poor creature's desire to throw up and rid itself of all that food and gas, nothing will budge. The stomach expands unchecked, destroying its own blood supply, driving into the chest and squashing the lungs and the blood flow back to the heart. There is no absolute timetable for how long an animal can survive in this state, but dogs can die in a matter of hours. As soon as the diagnosis is made, the clock is ticking.<br><br>"She got into a full bag of kibble around seven. Owner took her for a walk before bed. He could hear the dog trying to vomit unsuccessfully around midnight and drove her all the way up from the Cape. She looks ready to explode. Classic double-bubble on abdominal X-rays."<br><br>I had been waiting for this description, the twisted, distended stomach looking like the silhouette of a giant heavyweight's boxing glove on an X-ray. It tells me her diagnosis is correct.<br><br>"Is she stable?" I asked.<br><br>"Not really," said Dr. Keene. "Her pressures are through the floor and we're having a hell of a time just finding a decent vein, let alone placing a catheter."<br><br>My feet were swinging out of the bed and I began to fumble for clean clothes.<br><br>"Do your best. Try to pass a stomach tube. I'll be there as fast as I can."<br>Angell Animal Medical Center, part of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is located in the eclectic and increasingly gentrified Boston neighborhood of Jamaica Plain. There are no world rankings of veterinary hospital size, but at 185,000 square feet I imagine Angell is one of the larger ones, with over seventy veterinarians serving nearly fifty thousand dogs, cats, and exotic pets every year.<br>After ten years on staff as a surgeon, I know that those nasty rumors about Boston traffic are all subterfuge because at three in the morning, an easy commute is rewarded with my pick from one of the primo parking spots close to the front door.<br><br>It is January in New England. There are a couple of inches of snow on the ground, a miniature version of the Andes has been plowed against the perimeter wall, and today's high will be only ten below. I walk across the salted asphalt like a geriatric with a bad case of hemorrhoids, poised to slip on the black ice. Despite the hour, my sleepiness is starting to burn off like fog on an imaginary sunny morning as I enter this five-story brick building and head toward the nonsterile surgical prep area. The corridors are empty, floors polished, phones silent, and pagers dead. I have entered an antiseptic ghost town and I like the way it feels. It reminds me of being a kid again, of breaking into the neighbor's backyard in order to steal the ripe apples taunting me from their tree. The mission is covert, even risky--all but guaranteeing the rewards will make it worthwhile.<br><br>Cutting through the radiology department, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the glass window outside the MRI unit. The man I see looks unfamiliar. He has piggy eyes, a pillow-crease scar across his left cheek, and a jaunty case of bed head. Thank goodness my patients never judge me on my appearance.<br><br>My patient lies splayed across a large gurney, nervous nails clawing for purchase on the stainless steel surface. She is a big girl, obviously not lacking for love in the calorie department. Her darting chocolate eyes scream in fear of her strange situation and the changes taking place in her body, but as I enter the room and approach, her broad and bushy tail offers me a couple of friendly beats. I like German shepherds. I grew up with one as a kid, but this gesture strikes me as both uncharacteristic and, at the same time, utterly endearing. Until this moment I have been dealing with an anonymous and remote animal reduced to a list of diseases, conditions, problems, and deformities. Suddenly everything has changed. This animal has a name and a personality. This animal has become my patient. This is the moment when I begin to care.<br><br>I pat her head and run my hand across a soft velvety ear, over her chest and down to the enormous, unyielding abnormality that is her drum-tight abdomen.<br><br>"Hi, sweetheart. You hanging in there?"<br><br>For me, all my patients are "sweethearts" until proven otherwise, whether they are male or female, cute and cuddly Himalayan kittens or slobbering and stoic 250 pounds of bullmastiff.<br><br>Holding a needle and syringe, Dr. Keene, a short, shiny-faced woman with blond hair in a ponytail, turns to me. She can be no more than twenty-five. I wonder if at forty-three I'm getting a little long in the tooth for this game. She glares through sparkly green contacts as though she thought I had been addressing her. I introduce myself, offer my hand, and assure her that I was speaking to our patient.<br><br>"This is Sage," she says, trying to apply an oxygen mask to the dog's snout. "I'm Sarah, and this is Dan." She gestures to a technician I have never met before, although this is not surprising given the hour. For most of us working in a busy animal hospital, being on call for surgical emergencies every other night, every other weekend, is simply not sustainable for more than a couple of years. Nocturnal surgical emergencies are a rite of passage, an inherent requisite in any decent residency program, a privilege to be endured and enjoyed. But now, nearly fifteen years after the completion of my training, my midnight forays into the OR are limited to the one week in every month that I am available as backup to the residents.<br><br>Dan juts a square chin in my direction and gives me a casual " 'sup." He has a pierced right eyebrow and lower lip with colorful sleeves of tattoos running down his arms in perfect contrast to the sallow vampire skin of his face. In different surroundings he might attract attention, but here, working the overnight, he can relax, setting up the EKG leads, sorting out the pulse oximeter, and adjusting the intravenous fluids with an experienced hand.<br>There is a small shaved square on Sage's flank where an attempt has been made to release the trapped and expanding gas in the dog's stomach by directly puncturing the organ with a large bore needle. I touch the small red bull's-eye in the center of the bald spot. The skin is impossibly taut. Clearly the attempt failed.<br>"No luck with a tube?" I ask, although I know the question is redundant. If they had successfully passed a stomach tube, the preferred method of decompression, there would have been no need to try to use a needle.<br><br>Dr. Keene shakes her head.<br><br>"I'm afraid not," she says. "She's in bad shap...</p><h2>Incredible Cross-sections of Star Wars, Episode I - The Phantom Menace: The Definitive Guide to the Craft</h2><p>Richly detailed, full-color spreads reveal the inner workings of the various spacecraft, vehicles, and machines from the new blockbuster Star Wars movie, accompanied by explanations of each vehicle&#39;s use, structure, operation, and more. 1,200,000 first printing.</p><p>Want to get a battle-droid's-eye view of the inside of an AAT battle tank?

While exploring the ancient, exotic island kingdom of Riz, Charlotte foolishly lost her way. In a dizzying moment, she was snatched, bound up in a sack and unceremoniously dumped -- completely naked! -- in the ship's cabin of the very same man who had caught her fancy as a young girl in Seattle: Captain Patrick Trevarran. </p><p> But Charlotte's dream lover turned out to be no gentleman! He had once gallantly fetched her, as a mischievous teenager,from the riggings of his ship, but now he appraised her with exasperation and quickly packed her off to the harem of a sultan friend. When they were reunited -- as much by mercy as by fate -- it was clear that Patrick wished merely to tease and trifle with this pretty, rebellious American. But, through their adventure, Charlotte had discovered a provocative man torn between recklessness and devotion, between storm and calm. Now, with all the strength and passion she possessed, Charlotte would chart a course that would sweep them at last to their destiny -- a glorious and resounding love.</p></p><p>The daughter of a town marshal, Linda Lael Miller is the author of more than a hundred historical and contemporary novels.

Visit her at LindaLaelMiller.com.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Even at that midmorning hour, the air of the marketplace, or <i>souk,</i> shimmered and undulated with heat. Chickens squawked, vendors shouted and argued, monkeys wearing little vests and fezzes shrieked for attention, and strange, incessant music curled among the stalls in place of a breeze. The smells of spices and unwashed flesh competed with pungent smoke from cooking fires, and the bright silken folds of Charlotte's borrowed robe and veils clung to the moistness of her skin. </p><p> She was enthralled. </p><p> Her companion, Bettina Richardson, who was a few years younger than Charlotte and clad in a similar disguise, did not share this enthusiasm. </p><p> "Papa will <i>murder</i> us if he finds out we've come to this dreadful place!" she hissed, the veil covering her pretty face swelling with the rush of her breath. "Why, we could end up being carried off to the desert by some sheikh!" </p><p> Charlotte sighed. "We won't, more's the pity," she said, just to annoy Bettina. </p><p> "Charlotte!" Bettina cried, shocked. </p><p> Charlotte smiled behind her veils. The Richardsons had sailed to the island kingdom of Riz, which lay between Spain and the coast of Morocco, to visit old friends, wealthy merchants they had originally known in Boston. Bettina had wanted to stay in Paris until it was time to sail for London and then the United States, but Charlotte had campaigned against the idea. She wasn't about to miss a chance to visit such an exotic place as Riz, since there was at least <i>some</i> potential for adventure. </p><p> That, of course, was exactly what vexed Bettina so much. She'd had to be coerced into borrowing the robes and veils from their hostess's wardrobe, sneaking out by way of a side gate, and venturing through the narrow, dusty streets, following the odors and the cacophony of sounds to the <i>souk</i>. </p><p> Standing in front of one of the market stalls, Charlotte touched a crudely made basket tentatively. She would remember this day all her life, and out of desperate boredom, she would no doubt embellish it at some point. She might add a grand sheikh mounted on a fine Arabian stallion, riding to the marketplace to buy slaves, or perhaps even a band of marauding pirates, scattering chickens and merchants in every direction with their swords... </p><p> A stir at the end of the row of tawdry little booths and crevices in the ancient walls interrupted her colorful musings. Bettina grabbed Charlotte's forearm with surprising strength and whispered, "Let's go back to the Vincents' house, Charlotte, <i>please!"</i> </p><p> Charlotte stood staring at the tall man striding through the crowd, barely able to believe her eyes. For a few breathless moments, she was thirteen again and back in Seattle. She'd climbed up into the rigging of a sailing ship, the <i>Enchantress,</i> and high off the deck her courage had fled. She'd clung to the ropes, too terrified to climb down on her own. </p><p> Patrick Trevarren had come up to fetch her. </p><p> Bettina gave her a little shake. "Charlotte!" she pleaded balefully. "I don't like the looks of that man! He's probably a brigand!" </p><p> Charlotte couldn't move, and she was especially grateful for her veils because she knew the fluttery smile trembling on her mouth would be an idiotic one. Patrick hadn't changed a great deal in ten years, though he was broader through the chest and shoulders, and the angles of his face were sharper; he still wore his dark hair a little too long, caught back at his nape with a thin black ribbon, and his indigo gaze was as incisive as before. He walked with an arrogant assurance that infuriated Charlotte, and yet her heart was hammering in her throat and it was all she could do not to run to him and inquire if he remembered her. </p><p> He wouldn't, of course, and even if he did, she had been only a girl when they'd met last. She had dreamed about him all these ten years, weaving fantasy after fantasy around the young seaman, but he'd probably never given her so much as a second thought. </p><p> He drew nearer, and even though there was a smile on his darkly tanned, aristocratic face, his eyes were cold. He plucked a ripe orange from a fruit stand, using the point of a dagger drawn from his belt, and flipped a coin to the crouching vendor. </p><p> Charlotte neither moved nor made a sound, except to breathe, but something about her must have given him pause. He came and towered over her and the trembling Bettina, staring down into Charlotte's amber eyes with an expression of bemusement. </p><p> <i>Say something,</i> Charlotte ordered herself frantically, but she couldn't. Her throat was shut tight. </p><p> Patrick pondered her for another moment, ran his gaze over the clinging robes she wore, and then proceeded around her with a shrug. He peeled the orange as he went, tossing the parings to one of the chattering monkeys. </p><p> "That's it," Bettina said firmly. "We're leaving, Charlotte Quade, <i>this very minute.</i> That was a pirate if I've ever seen one!" </p><p> Charlotte watched as Patrick stopped to look up at a veiled and shapely creature dancing on a board stretched between two large barrels, and felt a jealousy so intense that her throat opened and her lungs started drawing air again. "And we all know you've seen your share of pirates," she retorted, with unusual sarcasm. Instantly she felt a twinge of remorse for her sharpness. For all that Bettina and she were not perfectly matched as friends, Bettina was a decent sort and quite fragile, undeserving of such treatment. </p><p> Tears had already welled in Bettina's green eyes. She was an only child, gently raised, and it had not been easy for her to disobey her parents by sneaking out of the Vincents' home to explore a foreign marketplace. </p><p> "I'm sorry," Charlotte said gently, feeling broken as she watched a smiling Patrick lift the dancer down from her improvised stage and toss a coin to a robed man slumping nearby. "We'll -- we'll go now." </p><p> Determined not to look back again, Charlotte squared her shoulders and started off in the direction of the Vincent compound. Her senses were in a riot of shock at seeing Patrick Trevarren so unexpectedly, and she couldn't bear even to consider where he might be taking the dancer. </p><p> She was distracted, and conscious of Bettina's rising anxiety, and finding the path they'd blazed only an hour earlier proved difficult, without the noise and flurry of the marketplace to guide her. All the impossibly narrow streets looked the same, and any one of a dozen might have led to the quiet residential area she had left so boldly. </p><p> Bettina was sniffling, and she dried her eyes with her veil. "I knew it," she fretted, "we're lost!" </p><p> "Hush," Charlotte snapped, impatient. "We'll just go back to the marketplace and ask directions." </p><p> "We don't speak the language," Bettina reminded her, with maddening accuracy. </p><p> "Then we'll simply start out again, trying every route until we find the right one," Charlotte answered. She sounded a great deal more confident than she felt. </p><p> Bettina mewled in alarm. "I shouldn't have listened to you," she cried angrily. "I <i>knew</i> something terrible would happen if we disobeyed Papa, and I was right!" </p><p> Charlotte bit her lower lip to keep from telling Bettina to shut up. "We will get back safely," she said, in a purposefully gentle voice, when she had her impatience in check. "I promise we will. But you must be calm, Bettina." </p><p> The younger girl drew a deep, tremulous breath and looked around at the empty street. It was eerie, how quiet the place was, after the clamor and excitement of the souk. </p><p> "I shall have to drink poison if we are taken captive and forced to live in a harem," Bettina warned, quite matter-of-factly, when she'd recovered a little of her composure. </p><p> Charlotte might have laughed, under less trying circumstances. The fact was, they probably <i>were</i> in grave danger, wandering unprotected in a city where the culture was so profoundly different from their own. </p><p> There was nothing to do now but return to the marketplace, try to find Mr. Trevarren, and prevail upon him to rescue her a second time. It would be an exquisite humiliation, especially since he was bound to be occupied in a most scandalous fashion with the dancer, if he was around at all, but Charlotte could see no alternative. She and Patrick had not parted on particularly cordial terms that long-ago day in Seattle, but he was probably the only person in the <i>souk</i> who spoke English. </p><p> She linked her arm with Bettina's. "Come along. We'll be back where we belong, sipping tea and eating chocolates, before your mother and father even miss us." </p><p> The marketplace, crowded before, was swelling with people and donkeys now. Charlotte stood on tiptoe, searching for Mr. Trevarren's bare head among the covered ones of the merchants and customers, but there was no sign of him. </p><p> Bettina let out a strangled whimper, and Charlotte controlled her irritation. </p><p> It was then that the crush of men pressed around them. A dirty cloth, pungent with some chemical, was placed over Charlotte's mouth and nose, and her arms were crushed to her sides. She heard Bettina screaming hysterically, and then the world receded to a pinpoint, disappeared. There was nothing except for an endless, throbbing void. </p><p> <br> Patrick Trevarren laid his hands to the sides of the dancer's trim waist and hoisted her back up onto the board. Feeling especially generous, he favored her with a grin and a surreptitious coin, and in that moment a shrill female scream punctured the thick atmosphere of the <i>souk.</i> </p><p> In Riz, as well as the rest of the Arab world, women were a commodity, but Patrick had grown up in Boston and studied in England. As a result, he was cursed with a strain of chivalry, and even though he sensed that responding to the damsel's noisy distress would be a mistake, he could not stop trying to find her. </p><p> He made his way through the crowd and found one of the two foreign women he'd encountered earlier. Her veil had slipped, and by the nasal quality of her continuous, snuffling wails, Patrick identified her as an American. </p><p> Exasperated, he took her shoulders in his hands and gave her a shake. "Stop that sniveling and tell me what's the matter!" </p><p> The curious Arabs retreated a little. </p><p> "My f-friend!" the girl sobbed. "M-My friend has been k-kidnapped by pirates!" </p><p> Patrick clamped his jaw down tight as he remembered looking into the other woman's wide amber eyes earlier. There had been something disturbingly familiar about her. "Where did this happen?" he asked, struggling for patience. "How many men were there? Did you see which direction they went?" </p><p> The girl made another loud lament. "There were at least a <i>hundred</i> of them," she eventually managed to choke out. Her green eyes were red-rimmed and puffy, and the end of her nose already looked raw. "And how should I know which way they went? I can't even find my way back to the Vincents' compound!" </p><p> Patrick picked a familiar face from the crowd, an earnest little boy who sometimes ran errands for him, and gave him a few pieces of silver. He knew the Vincents and had visited them on several occasions. </p><p> In quick Arabic, he instructed the boy to take the lady home -- she would obviously be no help at all in finding her friend. Then he began questioning bystanders. </p><p> Despite Patrick's easy command of the local language and the fact that he was well-known in the kingdom and received in homes on all levels of the social scale, he was still an outsider. The men frequenting the marketplace would sympathize with the kidnappers, not the girl. To them, the selling of innocent young women into virtual slavery was honest commerce. </p><p> Still, Patrick searched the alleyways that snaked away from the <i>souk</i> in every direction, a feeling of panic rising in him as he struggled to accept the hopelessness of his pursuit. The girl was lost; there would be no saving her from the fate that awaited her. </p><p> In the late afternoon, when the sun glared mercilessly down on the ancient, dusty city, Patrick returned to the harbor, where his ship, the <i>Enchantress,</i> was at anchor. </p><p> She was in a dark, cramped hole, a place that smelled of rats, mildew, and spoilage. Her head ached as though she'd been felled with a club, and nausea roiled in her stomach. Patches of tenderness all over her body told her she was black and blue, and where there wasn't a bruise, her skin stung with abrasions. </p><p> Charlotte wanted to throw up, but she was gagged, and when she moved to uncover her mouth, she discovered that her hands were bound as well. Tears of frustration and fear burned her eyes. </p><p> <i>You wanted an adventure,</i> she scolded herself. <i>Here it is.</i> </p><p> Hysteria threatened, but Charlotte would not surrender. She knew it was crucial not to panic; she had to think calmly and come up with a plan of escape. </p><p> Instead of strategy, however, she thought of Bettina. Had the kidnappers taken her, too? Charlotte shuddered to think how terrified the girl would be if that was true, and guilt lanced through her spirit. If Bettina came to harm, it would be Charlotte's own fault and no one else's. She had literally browbeaten her companion into visiting the <i>souk,</i> and the result might well be tragic. </p><p> Another rush of bile seared Charlotte's throat, and she swallowed. If she kept her wits about her, she might be able to find Bettina, and the two of them could flee their captors together. On the other hand, she might never see her friend again. </p><p> Colorful and patently horrifying pictures filled Charlotte's mind. She'd often pretended, in the privacy of her mind, to be a harem girl, with Patrick Trevarren as her sultan. It had been an innocent game, heating her loins and bringing a frustrated blush to her cheeks, but the reality of facing a life of white slavery was no schoolgirl fantasy. Of course, she wouldn't be sold to the man she'd dreamed about all these years -- oh, no. She would surely become the property of some whoremaster, or a concubine to some sweaty, slobbering wretch who valued her no more than he would a dog or a horse. </p><p> Charlotte thought of her home in Quade's Harbor, on the green shores of Puget Sound, where her father owned and operated one of the largest timber operations in Washington Territory. Brigham Quade was a man of very firm opinions, with no inclination at all toward nonsense, but Charlotte had never doubted his love for a moment. She and her sister, Millie, had always known he would give up his own life before letting anything happen to either one of them, and because of this certainty, they'd grown up to be confident and secure. </p><p> Lydia, their stepmother, had taught them to be strong women, unafraid to take risks and let their intelligence show, and for the most part, these traits had stood Charlotte in good stead. Until that morning -- if indeed it had been that morning -- when she'd awakened with the brilliant idea of putting on robes and veils and exploring the forbidden <i>souk.</i> </p><p> Charlotte pictured Millie, her beautiful, spirited sister, all dressed up in her lacy white wedding dress, eyes sparkling with love and excitement. She imagi...</p></p><h2>Astonishing X-Men, Vol. 3: Torn</h2><p>They&#39;re back! The chart-topping super-team of Joss Whedon and John Cassaday return for more Astonshing X-Men!

From as young as I can remember, I loved the city. Mine is a story of love reciprocated. It is the story of loss and hope, and of the strangeness that lies just beneath the surface tension of daily life, a strangeness infinite fathoms in depth.<br><br>The streets of the city weren&#x2019;t paved with gold, as some immigrants were told before they traveled half the world to come there. Not all the young singers or actors, or authors, became stars soon after leaving their small towns for the bright lights, as perhaps they thought they would. Death dwelt in the metropolis, as it dwelt everywhere, and there were more murders there than in a quiet hamlet, much tragedy, and moments of terror. But the city was as well a place of wonder, of magic dark and light, magic of which in my eventful life I had much experience, including one night when I died and woke and lived again.<br><br>2<br><br>When I was eight, I would meet the woman who claimed she was the city, though she wouldn&#x2019;t make that assertion for two more years. She said that more than anything, cities are people. Sure, you need to have the office buildings and the parks and the nightclubs and the museums and all the rest of it, but in the end it&#x2019;s the people&#x2014;�and the kind of people they are&#x2014;�who make a city great or not. And if a city is great, it has a soul of its own, one spun up from the threads of the millions of souls who have lived there in the past and live there now.<br><br>The woman said this city had an especially sensitive soul and that for a long time it had wondered what life must be like for the people who lived in it. The city worried that in spite of all it had to offer its citizens, it might be failing too many of them. The city knew itself better than any person could know himself, knew all of its sights and smells and sounds and textures and secrets, but it didn&#x2019;t know what it felt like to be human and live in those thousands of miles of streets. And so, the woman said, the soul of the city took human form to live among its people, and the form it took was her.<br><br>The woman who was the city changed my life and showed me that the world is a more mysterious place than you would imagine if your understanding of it was formed only or even largely by newspapers and magazines and TV&#x2014;�or now the Internet. I need to tell you about her and some terrible things and wonderful things and amazing things that happened, related to her, and how I am still haunted by them.<br><br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. I tend to do that. Any life isn&#x2019;t just one story; it&#x2019;s thousands of them. So when I try to tell one of my own, I sometimes go down an alleyway when I should take the main street, or if the story is fourteen blocks long, I sometimes start on block four and have to backtrack to make sense.<br><br>Also, I&#x2019;m not tapping this out on a keyboard, and I tend to ramble when I talk, like now into this recorder. My friend Malcolm says not to call it rambling, to call it oral history. That sounds pretentious, as though I&#x2019;m as certain as certain can be that I&#x2019;ve achieved things that ensure I&#x2019;ll go down in history. Nevertheless, maybe that&#x2019;s the best term. Oral history. As long as you understand it just means I&#x2019;m sitting here shooting off my mouth. When someone types it out from the tapes, then I&#x2019;ll edit to spare the reader all the you-�knows and uhs and dead-�end sentences, also to make myself sound smarter than I really am. Anyway, I must talk instead of type, because I have the start of arthritis in my fingers, nothing serious yet, but since I&#x2019;m a piano man and nothing else, I have to save my knuckles for music.<br><br>Malcolm says I must be a closet pessimist, the way I so often say, &#x201c;Nothing serious yet.&#x201d; If I feel a phantom pain in one leg or the other and Malcolm asks why I keep massaging my calf, I&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;Just this weird thing, nothing serious yet.&#x201d; He thinks I&#x2019;m convinced it&#x2019;s a deep-�vein blood clot that&#x2019;ll break loose and blow out my lungs or brain later in the day, though that never crossed my mind. I just say those three words to reassure my friends, those people I worry about when they have the flu or a dizzy spell or a pain in the calf, because I&#x2019;d feel relieved if they reassured me by saying, &#x201c;Nothing serious yet.&#x201d;<br><br>The last thing I am is a closet pessimist. I&#x2019;m an optimist and always have been. Life&#x2019;s given me no reason to expect the worst. As long as I&#x2019;ve loved the city, which is as long as I can remember, I have been an optimist.<br><br>I was already an optimist when all this happened that I&#x2019;m telling you about. Although I&#x2019;ll reverse myself now and then to give you some background, this particular story really starts rolling in 1967, when I was ten, the year the woman said she was the city. By June of that year, I had moved with my mom into Grandpa&#x2019;s house. My mother, whose name was Sylvia, was a singer. Grandpa&#x2019;s name was Teddy Bledsoe, never just Ted, rarely Theodore. Grandpa Teddy was a piano man, my inspiration.<br><br>The house was a good place, with four rooms downstairs and four up, one and three-�quarter baths. The piano stood in the big front room, and Grandpa played it every day, even though he performed four nights a week at the hotel and did background music three afternoons at the department store, in their fanciest couture department, where a dress might cost as much as he earned in a month at both jobs and a fur coat might be priced as much as a new Chevy. He said he always took pleasure in playing, but when he played at home, it was only for pleasure.<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to keep the music in you, Jonah, you&#x2019;ve got to play a little bit every day purely for pleasure. Otherwise, you&#x2019;ll lose the joy of it, and if you lose the joy, you won&#x2019;t sound good to those who know piano&#x2014;�or to yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, behind the house, a concrete patio bordered a small yard, and in the front, a porch overlooked a smaller yard, where this enormous maple tree turned as red as fire in the autumn. And when the leaves fell, they were like enormous glowing embers on the grass. You might say it was a lower-�middle-�class neighborhood, I guess, although I never thought in such terms back then and still don&#x2019;t. Grandpa Teddy didn&#x2019;t believe in categorizing, in labeling, in dividing people with words, and neither do I.<br><br>The world was changing in 1967, though of course it always does. Once the neighborhood was Jewish, and then it went Polish Catholic. Mr. and Mrs. Stein, who had moved from the house but still owned it, rented to my grandparents in 1963, when I was six, and sold it to them two years later. They were the first black people to live in that neighborhood. He said there were problems at the start, of the kind you might expect, but it never got so bad they wanted to move.<br><br>Grandpa attributed their staying power to three things. First, they kept to themselves unless invited. Second, he played piano free for some events at Saint Stanislaus Hall, next to the church where many in the neighborhood attended Mass. Third, my grandma, Anita, was secretary to Monsignor McCarthy.<br><br>Grandpa was modest, but I won&#x2019;t be modest on his behalf. He and Grandma didn&#x2019;t have much trouble also because they had about them an air of royalty. She was tall, and he was taller, and they carried themselves with quiet pride. I used to like to watch them, how they walked, how they moved with such grace, how he helped her into her coat and opened doors for her and how she always thanked him. They dressed well, too. Even at home, Grandpa wore suit pants and a white shirt and suspenders, and when he played the piano or sat down for dinner, he always wore a tie. When I was with them, they were as warm and amusing and loving as any grandparents ever, but I was at all times aware, with each of them, that I was in a Presence.<br><br>In April 1967, my grandma fell dead at work from a cerebral embolism. She was just fifty-�two. She was so vibrant, I never imagined that she could die. I don&#x2019;t think anyone else did, either. When she passed away suddenly, those who knew her were grief-�stricken but also shocked. They harbored unexpressed anxiety, as if the sun had risen in the west and set in the east, suggesting a potential apocalypse if anyone dared to make reference to that development, as if the world would go on safely turning only if everyone conspired not to remark upon its revolutionary change.<br><br>At the time, my mom and I were living in an apartment downtown, a fourth-�floor walk-�up with two street-�facing windows in the living room; in the kitchen and my little bedroom, there were views only of the sooty brick wall of the adjacent building, crowding close. She had a gig singing three nights a week in a blues club and worked the lunch counter at Woolworth&#x2019;s five days, waiting for her big break. I was almost ten and not without some street smarts, but I must admit that for a time, I thought that she would be equally happy if things broke either way&#x2014;�a gig singing in bigger and better joints or a job as a waitress in a high-�end steakhouse, whichever came first.<br><br>We went to stay with Grandpa for the funeral and a few days after, so he wouldn&#x2019;t be alone. Until then, I&#x2019;d never seen him cry. He took off work for a week, and he kept mostly to his bedroom. But I sometimes found him sitting in the window seat at the end of the second-�floor hallway, just staring out at the street, or in his armchair in the living room, an unread newspaper folded on the lamp table beside him.<br><br>When I tried to talk to him, he would lift me into his lap and say, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just be quiet now, Jonah. We&#x2019;ll have years to talk over everything.&#x201d;<br><br>I was small for my age and thin, and he was a big man, but I felt greatly gentled in those moments. The quiet was different from other silences, deep and sweet and peaceful even if sad. A few times, with my head resting against his broad chest, listening to his heart, I fell asleep, though I was past the age for regular naps.<br><br>He wept that week only when he played the piano in the front room. He didn&#x2019;t make any sounds in his weeping; I guess he was too dignified for sobbing, but the tears started with the first notes and kept coming as long as he played, whether ten minutes or an hour.<br><br>While I&#x2019;m still giving you background here, I should tell you about his musicianship. He played with good taste and distinction, and he had a tremendous left hand, the best I&#x2019;ve ever heard. In the hotel where he worked, there were two dining rooms. One was French and formal and featured a harpist, and the d�cor either made you feel elegant or made you ill. The second was an Art Deco jewel in shades of blue and silver with lots of glossy-�black granite and black lacquer, more of a supper club, where the food was solidly American. Grandpa played the Deco room, providing background piano between seven and nine o&#x2019;clock, mostly American-�standard ballads and some friskier Cole Porter numbers; between nine and midnight, three sidemen joined him, and the combo pumped it up to dance music from the 1930s and &#x2019;40s. Grandpa Teddy sure could swing the keyboard.<br><br>Those days right after his Anita died, he played music I&#x2019;d never heard before, and to this day I don&#x2019;t know the names of any of those numbers. They made me cry, and I went to other rooms and tried not to listen, but you couldn&#x2019;t stop listening because those melodies were so mesmerizing, melancholy but irresistible.<br><br>After a week, Grandpa returned to work, and my mom and I went home to the downtown walk-�up. Two months later, in June, when my mom&#x2019;s life blew up, we went to live with Grandpa Teddy full-�time.<br><br>3<br><br>Sylvia Kirk, my mother, was twenty-�nine when her life blew up, and it wasn&#x2019;t the first time. Back then, I could see that she was pretty, but I didn&#x2019;t realize how young she was. Only ten myself, I felt anyone over twenty must be ancient, I guess, or I just didn&#x2019;t think about it at all. To have your life blow up four times before you&#x2019;re thirty would take something out of anyone, and I think it drained from my mom just enough hope that she never quite built her confidence back to what it once had been.<br><br>When it happened, school had been out for weeks. Sunday was the only day that the community center didn&#x2019;t have summer programs for kids, and I was staying with Mrs. Lorenzo that late afternoon and evening. Mrs. Lorenzo, once thin, was now a merry tub of a woman and a fabulous cook. She lived on the second floor and accepted a little money to look after me when there were no other options, primarily when my mom sang at Slinky&#x2019;s, the blues joint, three nights a week. Sunday wasn&#x2019;t one of those three, but Mom had gone to a big-�money neighborhood for a celebration dinner, where she was going to sign a contract to sing five nights a week at what she described as &#x201c;a major venue,&#x201d; a swanky nightclub that no one would ever have called a joint. The club owner, William Murkett, had contacts in the recording industry, too, and there was talk about putting together a three-�girl backup group to work with her on some numbers at the club and to cut a demo or two at a studio. It looked like the big break wouldn&#x2019;t be a steakhouse waitress job.<br><br>We expected her to come for me after eleven o&#x2019;clock, but it was only seven when she rang Mrs. Lorenzo&#x2019;s bell. I could tell right off that something must be wrong, and Mrs. Lorenzo could, too. But my mom always said she didn&#x2019;t wash her laundry in public, and she was dead serious about that. When I was little, I didn&#x2019;t understand what she meant, because she did, too, wash her laundry in the communal laundry room in the basement, which had to be as public as you could wash it, except maybe right out in the street. That night, she said a migraine had just about knocked her flat, though I&#x2019;d never heard of her having one before. She said that she hadn&#x2019;t been able to stay for the dinner with her new boss. While she paid Mrs. Lorenzo, her lips were pressed tight, and there was an intensity, a power, in her eyes, so that I thought she might set anything ablaze just by staring at it too long.</p><h2>Tennessee Williams: Plays 1957-1980 (Library of America)</h2><p>Exploring human passion with daring and unflinching honesty, Tennessee Williams forged a poetic theater of raw psychological insight that fused realism and expressionism. Now, in an authoritative two-volume edition, The Library of America collects the plays that reveal a prophetic figure in American life and letters&#x2014;a writer of generous sympathies and uncompromising frankness who reached wide audiences with plays that revolutionized the themes and styles of the modern theater. This second volume traces Williams's career as it evolved in his adventurous and sometimes shocking later works, including <i>Orpheus Descending</i>, <i>Suddenly Last Summer</i>, and <i>Sweet Bird of Youth</i>, plays that stirred controversy when first produced because of their concern with acts of horrific violence; the satiric marital comedy <i>Period of Adjustment</i>; <i>The Night of the Iguana</i>, a moving drama set in Mexico that contains some of Williams's most lyric writing, and <i>The Eccentricities of a Nightingale</i>, a re-imagining of the earlier <i>Summer and Smoke</i>.<br><br><i>The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore</i>, with its use of Kabuki-like stylization, began a more experimental phase of Williams's writing, represented here by <i>Kingdom of Earth</i> (also known as <i>The Seven Descents of Myrtle</i>), <i>The Mutilated</i>, <i>Small Craft Warnings</i>, and <i>Out Cry</i>. In late plays such as <i>A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur</i> and the autobiographical <i>Vieux Carr�</i>, Williams returned to many of his earlier themes and settings.<br><br>This edition includes a newly researched chronology of Tennessee Williams's life, explanatory notes (including cast lists of many of the original productions), and an essay on the texts.</p><p>This volume is edited by Mel Gussow (1933&#x2013;2005), who was a drama critic, a cultural writer at <i>The New York Times</i>, and author of several books including <i>Edward Albee: A Singular Journey</i>, and by Kenneth Holditch, professor emeritus at the University of New Orleans, editor since 1989 of the <i>Tennessee Williams Journal</i>, and the author of <i>In Old New Orleans</i>.This set collects all of Williams's plays, including the recently rediscovered early efforts Spring Storm and Not About Nightingales up through his most famous works and later lesser-known dramas. These magnificent titles are essential for all academic and public libraries. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ask the Parrot</h2><p>Sometimes mystery master Donald E. Westlake is the author of uproarious crime capers. Sometimes he has a mean streak-and its name is Parker. From his noir classic <i>The Man with the Getaway Face</i> to his recent novel <i>Nobody Runs Forever</i>, whenever Westlake writes as Stark, he lets Parker run loose-a ruthless criminal in a world of vulnerable "straights." <br><br>On a sunny October afternoon a man is running up a hill. He's not dressed for running. Below him are barking police dogs and waiting up ahead is a stranger-with a rifle, a life full of regrets, and a parrot at home who will mutely witness just how much trouble the runner, Parker, can bring into an ordinary life.<br><br>The rabbit hunter is Tom Lindahl, a small-town lonely heart nursing a big-time grudge against the racetrack that fired him. He knows from the moment he sees Parker that he's met a professional thief-and a man with murder in his blood. Rescuing Parker from the chase hounds, Lindahl invites the fugitive into his secluded home. He plans to rip off his former employer and exact a deadly measure of revenge-if he can get Parker to help.<br><br>But Tom doesn't know Parker and that the desperate criminal will do anything to survive-no matter who has to die...</p><p>Richard Stark has been hailed as one of the inventors-and one of the true masters-of noir crime fiction. Stark's most recent Parker novels, <i>Comeback</i> and <i>Backflash</i>, were each selected as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. His first novel, <i>The Hunter</i>, became the classic 1967 movie <i>Point Blank</i>. Thirty years later, <i>The Hunter</i> was adapted again by Hollywood, in the hit Mel Gibson movie <i>Payback</i>. Richard Stark is also, at times, the mystery Grand Master Donald E. Westlake. To learn more about the author, you can visit www.donaldwestlake.com.In Stark's third Parker novel, the professional thief is fleeing through the backwoods of Massachussetts after a bank heist. He is rescued by Tom Lindahl, a recluse obsessed with getting back at the dog-racing company that he believes destroyed his life. The two form an unlikely pair as Parker, ever the opportunist, decides to help Lindahl rob the dog track. An ending that leaves the listener with many questions doesn't help this unusual story. However, William Dufris's performance is excellent and makes up for the weaknesses in the plot. Dufris's delivery of the characters' voices, complete with local accents, is totally believable. Author Stark is also known as Donald Westlake. S.S.R. � AudioFile 2007, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p>
